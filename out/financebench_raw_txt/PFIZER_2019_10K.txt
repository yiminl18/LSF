 in our 2019  Financial Report. Our businesses are heavil
y regulated in most of the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., the principal authority regulating our operations is the FDA. TheFDA regulates the safety and efficac
y of the products we offer and our research, quality, manufacturing processes, product promotion, advertising and productlabeling. Simi
lar regulations exist in most other countries, and in many countries the government also regulates our prices. In the EU, the EMA conducts thescientific evaluat
ion, supervision and safety monitoring of our products, and employs a centralized procedure for approval of medicines for the EU and theEuropean Economic Area c
ountries. In China, the NMPA is the primary regulatory authority for approving and supervising medicines. In Japan, the PMDA isinvolved in a wide range o
f regulatory activities, including clinical studies, approvals, post-marketing reviews and pharmaceutical safety. Health authorities inmany middle and lower 
income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (i.e., similar to the authority of the FDA or EMA) beforethey begin to conduct their applicat
ion review process and/or issue their final approval. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business — GovernmentRegulation and Price Constrain

l commercialization rights in certain smaller markets. BMS supplies the product to us at cost plus a percentageof the net sales to end-customers in these 
markets. Eliquis is part of the Novel Oral Anticoagulant market; the agents in this class were developed as alternativetreatment options to warfarin in app
ropriate patients.Xtandi is being develope
d and commercialized through a collaboration with Astellas. The two companies share equally in the gross profits (losses) related toU.S. net sales of Xta
ndi. Subject to certain exceptions, Pfizer and Astellas also share equally all Xtandi commercialization costs attributable to the U.S. market.In addition, Pfizer and Astel
las share certain development and other collaboration expenses, and Pfizer receives tiered royalties as a percentage of internationalXtandi net sales (recorded in 
Other (income)/deductions––net ). Xtandi is an androgen receptor inh ibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptorsignaling pathway within tumor c
ells.Bavencio (avelumab) is being 
developed and commercialized in collaboration with Merck KGaA. Both companies jointly fund the majority of development andcommercialization costs, and split 
equally any profits related to net sales generated from selling any products containing avelumab from this collaboration.Bavencio is a human an
ti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody.Pfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTSRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Innovation is critica
l to the success of our Company, and drug discovery and development are time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. Pfizer’s purpose isto deliver breakthroughs that change patient
s’ lives. R&D is at the heart of fulfi lling Pfizer’s purpose as we work to translate advanced science and technologiesinto the therapies that matter most.
Our R&D Priorities and Strategy
Our R&D priorities include:
•
delivering a pipeline of highly differentiated medicines and vaccines where Pfizer has a unique opportunity to bring the most important new therapies topatients in need;
•
advancing our capabilities that can position Pfizer for long-term R&D leadership; and•
advancing new models for partnerships with creativity, flexibility and urgency to deliver innovation to patients as quickly as possible.To that end, 
our R&D primarily focuses on:•
Oncology;•
Inflammation and Immunology;•
Vaccines;•
Internal Medicine;•
Rare Diseases; and •
Hospital. While a significant portion of
 R&D is done internally, we continue to seek out promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologiesdeveloped by third parties to in
corporate into our discovery and development processes or projects, as well as our product lines. We do so by entering intocollaboration, alliance and licens
e agreements with other companies, as well as leveraging acquisitions and equity- or debt-based investments. Theseagreements enable us to co-develop, l
icense or acquire promising compounds, technologies and/or capabilities. We also enter into agreements pursuant towhich a third party agrees to fund a port
ion of the development costs of one or more of our pipeline products in exchange for rights to receive potential milestonepayments, revenue sharing payments, prof
it sharing payments and/or royalties. Collaboration, alliance, license and funding agreements and equity- or debt-based investments allow us 
to share risk and cost. They also enable us to access external scientific and technological expertise, as well as provide us theopportunity to advance our own products and 
in-licensed or acquired products.For additional information, 
see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2 . Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Assets andLiabilities Held for Sale, Licensing Arra
ngements and Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements in our 2019  Financial Report. Our R&D Operations
We conduct R&D internally and 
also through contracts with third parties, through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and incooperation with other
 pharmaceutical firms. In 2019, we continued to strengthen our global R&D organization and pursue strategies intended to improveinnovation and overall product
ivity in R&D to achieve a sustainable pipeline that is positioned to deliver value in the near term and over time.Our R&D spending is conduct
ed through a number of matrix organizations:•
Research Units within our WRDM organization are generally responsible for research and early-stage development assets for our Biopharma business(assets that have not yet achieved proof-of-
concept). Our Research Units are organized by therapeutic area to enhance flexibility, cohesiveness and focus.Because of our structure, we are able to 
rapidly redeploy resources within a Research Unit between various projects as necessary because in manyinstances the workforce s
hares similar skills, expertise and/or focus.•
Our science-based and other platform-services organizations provide technical expertise and other services to the various R&D projects, and are organizedinto science-based func
tions (which are part of our WRDM organization), such as Pharmaceutical Sciences, Medicine Design, and non-science-basedfunctions, such as Facil
ities, Digital and Finance. Within each of these functions, we are able to migrate resources among projects, candidates and/ortargets in any therapeutic area and in mo
st phases of development, allowing us to react quickly in response to evolving needs. In addition, the WorldwideMedical and Safety gro
up, within WRDM, ensures that Pfizer provides all stakeholders–– including patients, healthcare providers, pharmacists, payers andhealth authorities
–– with complete and up-to-date information on the risks and benefits associated with Pfizer products so that they can make appropriatedecisions on how and whe
n to use Pfizer’s medicines.•
Our R&D organization within Upjohn supports the off-patent branded and generic established medicines and helps to develop product enhancements, newindications and new market
 registrations for these medicines.Pfizer Inc.
2019 Form 10-K 6 
TABLE OF CONTENTS•
Our Global Product Development (GPD) organization is a unified center for  clinical development and regulatory activities that is generally responsible for theclinical development strategy 
and operational execution of clinical trials for both early-stage assets in the WRDM portfolio as well as late-stage assets in theBiopharma portfolio.
We manage R&D operations on a tota
l-company basis through our matrix organizations described above. Specifically, the Portfolio Strategy & Investmentcommittee, comprised of s
enior executives, is accountable for aligning resources among all of our WRDM, GPD and Biopharma R&D projects and for seeking toensure optimal capital allocatio
n across the innovative R&D portfolio. We believe that this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility. OurUpjohn R&D organization manag
es its resources separately from the WRDM and GPD organizations, with operational support from GPD for select clinicaldevelopment regulatory
 activities and from WRDM for clinical supply operations and global pharmacovigilance processing.Generally, we do not disaggregate tota
l R&D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since, as described above, we do not manage our R&Doperations by development phase or by therapeut
ic area. Further, as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly, we believe that any prior-period information about R&
D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending.For additional information on ou
r R&D operations and expenses, see the Costs and Expenses — Research and Development (R&D) Expenses section in our 2019
 Financial Report. Our R&D Pipeline and Competition
The discovery and development of safe, effect
ive new products, as well as the development of additional uses for existing products, are necessary for thecontinued strength of our businesses. 
Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after manyyears of research and development. The proce
ss from discovery to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years.As of 
January 28, 2020 , we had the following number of projects in various stages of R&D:
Development of a single compound 
is often pursued as part of multiple programs. While these drug candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatoryapproval, new drug candidates enter
ing clinical development phases are the foundation for future products. In addition to discovering and developing newproducts, our R&D efforts seek to add 
value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness, enhancing ease of dosing and by discovering potential newindications for them.
Information concerning severa
l of our drug candidates in development, as well as supplemental filings for existing products, is set forth in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income
— Product Developments––Biopharmaceutical section in our 2019  Financial Report, which is incorpor ated by reference.Our competitors also devote substant
ial funds and resources to R&D. We also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developingpotential drug candidates. The extent to wh
ich our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products andpotential sales of products in de
velopment, as well as unanticipated product obsolescence. In addition, several of our competitors operate without large R&Dexpenses and make a regular practi
ce of challenging our product patents before their expiration. For additional information, see the Competition  and Item 1A. Risk Factors

TABLE OF CONTENTSINTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
We have significant operat
ions outside the U.S. In 2019, operations in developed and emerging markets were managed through our business segments:Biopharma, Upjohn and, through Jul
y 31, 2019, Consumer Healthcare. Emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership, andour commercial structu
re recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastest-growing emerging markets are becoming more closelyaligned with the profile f
ound within developed markets. Urbanization and the rise of the middle class in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, provide growthopportunities for our
 medicines.We sell our products in o
ver 125 countries. Revenues from operations outside the U.S. of $27.9 billion  accounted for 54%  of our total revenues in 2019 . Revenues exceeded $500 mill
ion in each of eleven countries outside the U.S. in 2019, 2018 and 2017. By total revenues, China and Japan are our two largestnational markets outside the U.
S. For a geographic breakdown of revenues, see the Analysis of the Consol idated Statements of Income— Revenues— Overviewand
 —Revenues by Operating Segment and Geography sections and the table captioned Geographic Information  in the Notes to Cons olidated FinancialStatements—

Our international operations are 
subject, in varying degrees, to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries, including, among otherthings, currency fluctuation
s, capital and exchange control regulations and expropriation and other restrictive government actions. See the Item 1A. Risk Factors
— International Operations section in this 2019 Form 10-K. Our international businesses are also subject to government-imposed constraints, includinglaws and regulations on pr

MARKETING
In our global biopharmaceutica
l businesses, we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients. Through our marketing organizations, we explain theapproved uses, benefits and risks of ou
r products to healthcare providers, such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists; MCOs thatprovide insurance coverage, su
ch as hospitals, Integrated Delivery Systems, PBMs and health plans; and employers and government agencies who hire MCOsto provide health benefits to their emp
loyees. We also market directly to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer advertising that seeks tocommunicate the approved uses, benefits and 
risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors. In addition, wesponsor general advertising to edu
cate the public on disease awareness, prevention and wellness, important public health issues, and our patient assistanceprograms.
Our prescription pharmace
utical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies andpharmacies, and, in t
he case of our vaccines products in the U.S., we primarily sell directly to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wholesalers,individual provide
r offices, retail pharmacies, and integrated delivery networks. We seek to gain access for our products on healthcare authority and PBMformularies, which are lists of a
pproved medicines available to members of the PBMs. PBMs use various benefit designs, such as tiered co-pays for formularyPfizer Inc.

PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
Our products are sold around the wor
ld under brand-name, logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider, in the aggregate, to be of materialimportance to Pfizer. Trademar
k protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and, in other countries, for as long as it is registered.Registrations generally are f
or fixed, but renewable, terms.We own or license a number of 
U.S. and foreign patents. These patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses, pharmaceutical formulations,product manufacturing processes and 
intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing.Patents for individual produ
cts extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countrieswhere patent protection is obtained. The actua
l protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, thescope of its coverage and the availab
ility of legal remedies in the country. Further, patent term extension may be available in many major countries tocompensate for a regulatory delay 
in approval of the product. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business — Government Regulation and PriceConstraints
— Outside the United States— Intellectual Property section in this 2019 Form 10-K. In various markets, a period of regu
latory exclusivity may be provided to certain drugs upon approval. The scope and term of such exclusivity will vary but, ingeneral, the period of regulatory exc
lusivity will run concurrently with the term of any existing patent rights associated with the drug at the time of approval.In the aggregate, our patent and related rights are of mater
ial importance to our businesses in the U.S. and most other countries. Based on current productsales, and considering the v
igorous competition with products sold by our competitors, the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our businessas a whole, together with the year 
in which the basic product patent expires (including, where applicable, grant of an additional six-month pediatric extensionand/or the granted patent term extension in the U.S. and 
Japan and Supplementary Patent Certificate in Europe), are those for the medicines set forth in thetable below. Unless other
wise indicated, the years set forth in the table below pertain to the basic product patent expiration for the respective products. Patentterm extensions, supplementary p
rotection certificates and pediatric exclusivity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed in the table below, unlessthey have been granted by the issuing authorit
y. In some instances, there are later-expiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms orcompositions, to methods of manufactur
ing, or to use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions. However, in some cases, such patentsmay not protect our drug from generic or, a
s applicable, biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent.Pfizer Inc.

 Bavencio is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Merck KGaA.The loss, expiration or in
validation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of co-promotion and licensingrights can have a signifi
cant adverse effect on our revenues. Many of our branded products have multiple patents that expire at varying dates, therebystrengthening our overall patent protect
ion. However, once patent protection has expired or has been lost prior to the expiration date as a result of a legalchallenge, we typically lose exclusivity on
 these products, and generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical manufacturers generally produce identical or highly similarproducts and sell them for a lo
wer price. The date at which generic or biosimilar competition commences may be different from the date that the patent orregulatory exclusivity expires. However,
 when generic or biosimilar competition does commence, the resulting price competition can substantially decrease ourrevenues for the impacted products, often in a 
very short period of time. In some cases, however, we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from productmanufacturing trade secrets; patents on uses fo
r products; patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients;patents for special formulat
ions of the product or delivery mechanisms; or conversion of the active ingredient to OTC products.Also, if one of our patents is found to be in
valid by judicial, court or administrative proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination oropposition proceedings, before the U.
S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts, generic or competitive productscould be introduced into the market re
sulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccineportfolio were challenged 
in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. For additional information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors — PatentProtection
 section in this 2019 Form 10-K. Companies have filed appl
ications with the FDA seeking approval of product candidates that such companies claim either do not infringe our patents or ourpatents are invalid; these inc
lude candidates that would compete with, among other products, Eliquis, Ibrance and Xeljanz. We will continue to aggressivelydefend our patent rights whenever we deem approp

Biologic Products
Our biologic products, in
cluding BeneFIX, ReFacto, Xyntha, Bavencio, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 and Enbrel (we market Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada),already face, or may 
face in the future, competition from biosimilars (also referred to as follow-on biologics). In the U.S., such  biosimilars would reference ouroriginator biologic products 
approved under the U.S. Public Health Service Act. Additionally, the FDA has approved a follow-on recombinant human growthhormone that referenced our biotechnology produ
ct, Genotropin, that was approved under the FFDCA.Biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines 
that have been developed and proven to be highly similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacyand that have 
no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity or potency. Biosimilars have the potential to offer high-quality, lower-cost alternatives tobiologic medicine
s. Abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and, since the passage of the ACA in 2010, aframework for such approval e
xists in the U.S. In Europe, the European Commission grants marketing authorizations for biosimilars pursuant to a set of generaland product class-specific g
uidelines for biosimilar approvals.As part of our business strategy, 
we are capitalizing on our expertise in biologics manufacturing, as well as our regulatory and commercial strengths, to developand commercialize biosimilar medicines. Some 
of the biosimilars that we currently market include Inflectra, Nivestym, Retacrit, Zirabev, Ruxience and Trazimerain the U.S.; Inflectra
, Retacrit, Nivestim and Trazimera in the EU; and Ixifi, Trazimera, Zirabev and Ruxience in Japan.  See the Item 1A. Risk Factors

TABLE OF CONTENTSWe may face litigation 
with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to our biologic products. Likewise, as we develop, manufacture and seek tolaunch biosimila
rs, patents may be asserted against us.International
One of the main limitations on ou
r operations in some countries outside the U.S. is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products. Underinternational and U.S. free trade agree
ments in recent years, we have seen some improvement in global protection of intellectual property rights. For additionalinformation, see the 
Item 1. Business — Government Regulation and Price Constraints— Outside the United States— Intellectual Property section in this 2019 Form 10-K.
COMPETITION
Our businesses are conducted in 
intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets. Many of our prescription  pharmaceutical products face competition inthe form of bran
ded or generic drugs or biosimilars that treat similar diseases or indications. The principal forms of c ompetition include efficacy, safety, ease ofuse, and cost effectiveness. Though the means of compet
ition vary among product categories and business groups, demonstrating the value of our products is acritical factor for success in all o
f our principal businesses.Our competitors include o
ther worldwide research-based biopharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus andgeneric and biosimi
lar drug manufacturers. We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar tothose treated by our major products.
This competition affects our co
re product business, which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medicalneeds and provide 
therapeutic improvements. Our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multi-billion-dollar investment in R&D, as well as our businessdevelopment transactions, both designed to 
result in a strong product pipeline. Our investment in research does not stop with drug approval; we continue toinvest in further demonstrating the 
value of our products for the conditions they treat, as well as potential new applications. We seek to protect the health andwell-being of patients by 
striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated topatients, physicians, payer
s and global health authorities. We also seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceuticalfunctions, including coord
inating support for our efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products to our customers.Operating conditions have become mo
re challenging under mounting global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment. We continue totake measures to evaluate, adapt and improve ou
r organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs. We believe that we havetaken an industry-leading ro
le in evolving our approaches to U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising, interactions with, and payments to, healthcare professionals,and medical education grants. We a
lso continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers, as we strive to advance fundamentalhealth system change through support for better hea
lthcare solutions.Our vaccines business ma
y face competition from the introduction of alternative vaccines. For example, Prevnar 13 may face competition in the form ofcompetitor vaccines, including v
accines with additional serotypes or “next-generation” pneumococcal conjugate vaccines prior to or after the expiration of itspatents, which may adversel
y affect our future results.Our generics and biosimilars busin
esses compete with branded products from competitors, as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers. Globally,Pfizer sells generic versions of Pfizer’s,
 as well as certain competitors’, solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products. We also sell biosimilars ofcertain inflammation & immunology
 and oncology biologic medicines globally. We seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a “first-to-market” or earlymarket position for our
 generic injectable drugs and biosimilars, as a “first-to-market” position provides customers a lower-cost alternative immediately whenavailable and also may provid
e us with potentially higher levels of sales and profitability until other generic or biosimilar competitors enter the market.Managed Care Organizations
The evolution of managed care in the U.S. ha
s been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace. Approximately 300 million peoplein the U.S. now have some form of hea
lth insurance coverage. Due to the expansion of health insurance coverage (see the Item 1. Business — GovernmentRegulation and Price Constrain
ts— In the United States section in this 2019 Form 10-K ), the marketing of prescription drugs to both consumers and the entitiesthat manage this expanded coverage in the U.S. 
continues to grow in importance.The influence of MCOs has inc
reased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through MCOs. At the same time, thoseorganizations have been consol
idating into fewer, even larger entities. This consolidation enhances both their ability to negotiate, as well as their importance toPfizer.
The growth of MCOs has increased p
ressure on drug prices as well as revenues. One objective of MCOs is to contain and, where possible, reduce healthcareexpenditures. MCOs typically ne
gotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by usingPfizer Inc.

lable or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine), volumepurchasing, long-term contract
s and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs. In addition, by placing branded medicines on higher-tier status in their formu
laries (leading to higher patient co-pays) or non-preferred tier status, MCOs transfer a portion of the cost of the medicine to the patient,resulting in signif
icant out-of-pocket expenses for the patient, especially for chronic treatments. This financial disincentive is a tool for MCOs to manage drugcosts and channel p
atients to medicines preferred by the MCOs. MCOs also use additional measures such as new-to-market blocks, exclusion lists, indication-based pricing and “copay accumu
lator” programs to improve their cost containment efforts. We are closely monitoring these newer approaches and developingappropriate strategies to respond to them.
Due to their generally lower c
ost, generic medicines typically are placed in lowest cost tiers of MCO formularies. The breadth of the products covered byformularies can vary con
siderably from one MCO to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particularmedical problems.
Exclusion of a product from a for
mulary or other MCO-implemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the MCO patient population and beyond.Consequently, pharmaceutica
l companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products. Unique product features, such as greater efficacy, betterpatient ease of use, or fewer side effects, a
re generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies. However, lower overall cost of therapy is also an importantfactor. We have be
en generally, although not universally, successful in having our major products included on MCO formularies. However, increasingly ourbranded products are being placed on the higher t
iers or in a non-preferred status.MCOs also emphasize pr
imary and preventive care, out-patient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as another way to managecosts. Hospitalizat
ion and surgery, typically the most expensive forms of treatment, are carefully managed. Since the use of certain drugs can reduce the needfor hospitalization, profes
sional therapy, or even surgery, such drugs can become favored first-line treatments for certain diseases.The ACA has accelerated
 payment reform by distributing risk across MCOs and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality whilereducing costs, which c
reates pressure on MCOs to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business — GovernmentRegulation and Price Constrain
ts— In the United States—Healthcare Reform section in this 2019 Form 10-K. Generic Products
One of the biggest competitive chal
lenges that our branded products face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. Upon the expiration or loss of patentprotection for a product, especial
ly a small molecule product, we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. Severalcompetitors make a regular pra
ctice of challenging our product patents before their expiration. Generic competitors often operate without large R&D expenses,as well as without co
sts of conveying medical information about products to the medical community. In addition, the FDA approval process exempts genericsfrom costly and time-consu
ming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data ofthe innovator product. Generic compet
itors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less.In China, for example, we are expe
cted to face further intensified competition by certain generic manufacturers in 2020, which may result in price cuts andvolume loss of some of 
our products. In addition, our patent-protected products can face 
competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity.As noted above, MCOs that focus prima
rily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage theuse of generics as alt
ernatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs, including Medicaid in the U.S. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and in somecases require, pharmacist
s to substitute, for brand-name drugs, generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be chemically andtherapeutically equiva
lent to brand-name drugs. In a small subset of states, prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution. Favoringgenerics may reduce sales of ou
r branded products.RAW MATERIALS
Raw materials essential to our 
businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers. In general, these materials areavailable from multiple sources. 
In 2019 , we experienced periodic shortages of select materials due to constrained capacity or operational challenges with theassociated suppliers. Supp
lier management activities are ongoing to work to ensure the necessary supply to meet our requirements for these materials. Nosignificant impact to our ope
rations is anticipated in 2020.Pfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTSGOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS
Pharmaceutical companie
s are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which they do business. Certain laws andregulations that gov
ern Pfizer’s business are discussed below.General
.  Our business has been and will continue to be subject to numerous laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, includingthose governing the manufacture and marketing of ou
r products, could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions by various governmentalbodies. For additional infor
mation on these proceedings and actions, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 16 A . Contingencies andCertain Commitments
— Legal Proceedings in our 2019  Financial Report. Criminal charges,  substantial fines and/or civil penalties, warning letters and productrecalls or seizures, delays in pro
duct approvals, as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, could result from suchproceedings and actions.
In the United States
Drug Regulation
.  In the U.S., biopharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by the FDA, including regulations that govern,among other things, the safety and efficacy of our 
medicines, clinical trials, advertising and promotion, manufacturing, labeling and record keeping. Our productsare also subject to p
ost-market surveillance under the FFDCA and its implementing regulations with respect to drugs, as well as the Public Health Service Actand its implementing regula
tions with respect to biologics.Other U.S. federal agencies, in
cluding the DEA, also regulate certain of our products. Many of our activities also are subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC.Biopharmaceutical compan
ies seeking to market a product in the U.S. must first test the product to demonstrate that it is safe and effective for its intended use.If, after evaluation, the FDA determine
s the product is safe (i.e., its benefits outweigh its known risks) and effective, then the FDA will approve the product formarketing, issuing a New Drug Ap
plication or Biologics License Application, as appropriate. Companies seeking to market a generic prescription drug mustscientificall
y demonstrate that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. The Abbreviated New Drug Application, or generic drug application, mustshow, among other things, that the generic drug 
is pharmaceutically equivalent to the brand, the manufacturer is capable of making the drug correctly, and theproposed label is the same as that of the 
innovator/brand drug’s label.Even after a drug
 or biologic is approved for marketing, it may still be subject to postmarketing commitments or postmarketing requirements. Postmarketingcommitments are studies or 
clinical trials that the drug or biologic sponsor has agreed to conduct, but are not required by law and/or regulation. Postmarketingrequirements include stud
ies and clinical trials that sponsors are required to conduct, by law and/or regulation, as a condition of approval. Postmarketing studiesor clinical tr
ials can be required in order to assess a known risk or demonstrate clinical benefit for drugs or biologics approved pursuant to accelerated approval.If a company fails to meet its post
marketing requirements, the FDA may assess a civil monetary penalty, issue a warning letter or deem the drug or biologicmisbranded. Once a drug or biolog
ic is approved, the FDA must be notified of any modifications to the product and the FDA may also require a manufacturer tosubmit additional studies or
 conduct clinical trials. In addition, we are also required to report adverse events and comply with cGMPs, as well as advertising andpromotion regulations. 
Failure to comply with the FFDCA may subject us to administrative and/or judicial sanctions, including warning letters, product recalls,seizures, delays in product
 approvals, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution.Biosimilar Regulation.
 The ACA created a framework for the approval of biosimilars (also known as follow-on biologics) following the expiration of 12 years ofexclusivity for the innovator
 biologic, with a potential six-month pediatric extension. Under the ACA, biosimilar applications may not be submitted until four yearsafter the approval of the reference innovator b
iologic.The FDA is responsible fo
r implementation of the legislation and approval of new biosimilars. Through FDA approvals and the issuance of draft and finalguidance, the FDA has addressed a number of 
issues related to the biosimilars approval pathway, such as the labeling expectations for biosimilars. Forexample, in 2019, the FDA issued f
inal guidance regarding the standards for demonstrating interchangeability with a U.S.-licensed reference product. Inaddition, in 2017, 
the Biosimilar User Fee Act was reauthorized for a five-year period, which led to a significant increase in the FDA’s biosimilar user feerevenues, thereby providing the FD
A with additional resources to process biosimilar applications. For example, since the enactment of the newly authorized feestructure, the FDA es
timates its revenues from biosimilar user fees generally will exceed $40 million.Sales and Marketing Laws 
and Regulations.  The marketing practices of U.S. biopharmaceutical companies are generally subject to various federal and statehealthcare laws that are intended, among othe
r things, to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and to protect the integrity of governmenthealthcare programs. 
These laws include anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a biopharmaceutical company fromsoliciting, offering, receiving, 
or paying anything of value to generate business, including purchasing or prescribing of a particular product. False claims lawsgenerally prohibit anyone
 from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for goods (including drugs or biologics) orservices to third-party pa
yers (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent and generally treat claims generated through kickbacks as false orfraudulent. Violations o
f fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs (includingMedicare and Medicaid). T
he federal governmentPfizer Inc.
2019 Form 10-K 14 
TABLE OF CONTENTSand various states also have enacted 
laws to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies. The laws and regulations generally limitfinancial interaction
s between manufacturers and healthcare providers, require disclosure to the federal or state government and the public of such interactions,and/or require the adoption of complian
ce standards or programs. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrativeguidance for implementation. Ind
ividual states, acting through their attorneys general, have become active as well, seeking to regulate the marketing ofprescription drugs under
 state consumer protection and false advertising laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could besubject to the penalties under the pertinent 
laws and regulations.Pricing and Reimbursement
.  Pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products depends in part on government regulation. Pfizer must offer discountedpricing or rebates on purchases of pha
rmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program,the “federal ceiling price” dr
ug pricing program, the 340B drug pricing program and the Medicare Part D Program. Pfizer must also report specific prices togovernment agencies under healthcare prog
rams, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B. The calculations necessary to determinethe prices reported are complex and the fa
ilure to report prices accurately may expose Pfizer to penalties. See the discussion regarding rebates in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income
— Revenues— Overview section and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 1 G . Basis of Presentationand Significant Accounting
 Policies: Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable in our 2019  Financial Report, wh ich are incorporated by reference.Government and private third-party pa
yers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products. Efforts by government officials or legislatorsto implement measures to regulate p
rices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including proposed action on drug importation, could adversely affect ourbusiness if implemented. The
re continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, and measures to address the perceivedhigh cost of pharmac
euticals are being considered by Congress, the Presidential Administration and select states. For example, recent legislation revised howmanufacturers calculate the average 
manufacturer price on branded drugs with authorized generics under the Medicaid drug rebate program, which theCongressional Budget Of
fice has estimated will reduce Medicaid costs by over $3 billion over the next decade. Proposals for even more far-reaching reform,such as immediately eliminating or 
phasing out private health insurance, are being proposed by some Democratic candidates for U.S. President. In particular,several states have enacted or are cons
idering transparency laws that require prescription drug manufacturers to report to the state and make public priceincreases, and sometimes to pro
vide a written justification for the increase. In addition to new state transparency laws and the introduction of several Federalpricing bills, we have also seen 
the Presidential Administration introduce proposals related to importation and express interest in international reference pricingin Medicare Part B. We expe
ct to see continued focus in regulating pricing resulting in additional legislation and regulation that could adversely impact revenue.In addition, U.S. government action to 
reduce federal spending on entitlement programs including Medicare and Medicaid may affect payment for our productsor services associated 
with the provision of our products. For additional information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors — U.S. Entitlement Reform section in this 2019 Form 10-K. Also, the major
ity of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain pharmaceutical products under Medicaid. Restrictions exist for somePfizer products under certain 
state Medicaid programs. As another example, access to our products under the Medicaid managed care program is typicallydetermined by the health plans w
ith which state Medicaid agencies contract to provide services to Medicaid beneficiaries. States continue to explore options forcontrolling healthcare co
sts related to Medicaid and other state healthcare programs, including the implementation of supplemental rebate agreements under theMedicaid drug rebate program that are t
ied to patient outcomes. In addition, we expect that consolidation and integration among pharmacy chains andwholesalers, who collectively are the
 primary purchasers of our pharmaceutical products in the U.S., and PBMs will increase pricing pressures onpharmaceutical manufacturers, 
including us. For additional information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors — Managed Care Trends section in this 2019 Form 10-K. The potential for additional pr
icing and access pressures in the commercial sector continues to be significant. Many employers have adopted high deductiblehealth plans, which can in
crease out-of-pocket costs for medicines. This is a trend that is likely to continue. Private third-party payers, such as health plans,increasingly challenge pharmace
utical product pricing, which could result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products.Pricing pressures for our pr
oducts may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets. Healthcare provider purchasers, directly or through grouppurchasing organizations,
 are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes.Overall, there is inc
reasing pressure on U.S. providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value interms of health outcomes. Longer term, we a
re seeing a shift in focus away from fee-for-service payments towards outcomes-based payments and risk-sharingarrangements that reward provider
s for cost reductions and improved patient outcomes. These new payment models can, at times, lead to lower prices for, andrestricted access to, new med
icines. At the same time, these models can also promote utilization of drugs by encouraging physicians to screen and diagnoseand consider drugs as
 a means of forestalling more costly medical interventions.We believe medicine
s are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system. We workwith law makers and advo
cate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes, lower costs to the healthcare system, and ensure access tomedicines within an eff
icient and affordable healthcare system. In addition, in response to the evolving U.S. and global healthcare spending landscape, we workwith health authorities, hea
lth technology assessment and quality measurement bodies and major U.S. payers throughout the product-development process tobetter

. Healthcare Reform.
 There have been significant efforts at the federa l and state levels to reform the healthcare system by enhancing access to healthcare,improving the deliver
y of healthcare and further rationalizing payment for healthcare. We face uncertainties due to federal legislative and administrative efforts torepeal, substantially mod
ify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. There is additional uncertainty given the ruling in December 2019 by the U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals for 
the Fifth Circuit in Texas v. Azar that the individual man date, which is a significant provision of the ACA, is unconstitutional. The casehas been remanded to a lower court to determ
ine whether the individual mandate is inseparable from the entire ACA, in which case the ACA as a whole wouldbe rendered unconstitutional. In the meanti
me, the remaining provisions of the law remain in effect. The revenues generated for Pfizer by the health insuranceexchanges and Medicaid expansion unde
r the ACA are not material, so the impact of full invalidation of the law is expected to be limited. However, any futurereplacement for the
 ACA may adversely affect our business and financial results, particularly if the legislation reduces incentives for employer-sponsoredinsurance coverage or dramati
cally increases industry taxes and fees. Any future healthcare reform efforts may adversely affect our business and financialresults.
Anti-Corruption. 
The FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreigngovernment official, government 
staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPAincludes interactions with certain
 healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.Data Privacy. 
Pfizer collects per sonal data as part of its regular business activities. The collection and use of this data is subject to privacy and data securitylaws and regulations, including
 oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. For example, we are subject to the California Consumer PrivacyAct (CCPA). The C
CPA, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, imposes numerous obligations on us, including a duty to disclose the categories of personaldata that we collect, sell, o
r share about California consumers, and gives those consumers rights regarding their personal data. Noncompliance with any of theselaws could result 
in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop non-compliant activities, and could damage our reputation and harm our business.Outside the United States
We encounter similar regulatory
 and legislative issues in most countries outside the U.S.New Drug Approvals.
 In the EU, the approval of new drugs may be a chieved using the Mutual Recognition Procedure, the Decentralized Procedure or the EUCentralized Procedure. These p
rocedures apply in the EU member states, plus the European Economic Area countries, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. TheCentralized Procedure, managed b
y the EMA, results in one single authorization for the whole EU, which provides the most rapid and efficient means of gainingapproval across the EU and i
s the one most commonly used for new products.In China, the regulatory system h
istorically presented numerous challenges for the pharmaceutical industry, as its requirements for drug development andregistration were often incon
sistent with U.S. or other international standards. In recent years, however, China has introduced reforms and draft reforms, whichare discussed in more detai
l below, that attempt to address these challenges. Furthermore, in 2017, the China regulatory authority, the National MedicalProducts Administration (NMPA), bec
ame a member of the International Council for Harmonization (ICH), which has resulted in greater adoption of internationaltechnical guidelines and p
ractices by the government. 2019 was another active year in this respect, with a number of reforms coming into effect, and moreproposals and drafts being issued fo
r consultation.In Japan, the PMDA is the point of entry fo
r businesses looking to sell drugs in the country. The PMDA, which is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities,including clin
ical studies, approvals, postmarketing reviews and pharmaceuticals safety, must approve an application before a new drug product may bemarketed in Japan. 
The PMDA also offers consultations on clinical trials of new drugs and provides advice on product classifications and approvals.Health authorities in man
y middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (i.e., similar to the authority of theFDA or the EMA) before
 they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval. Many authorities also require local clinical datain the country’s popula
tion in order to receive final marketing approval.Pharmacovigilance.
 In the EU, the EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee has the responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations onproduct safety issues for the EU autho
rities. EU regulators may require pharmaceutical companies to conduct post-authorization safety and efficacy studies atthe time of approval, or at any time after
wards in light of scientific developments. There are also additional extensive requirements regarding adverse drugreaction reporting and additiona
l monitoring of products. Outside developed markets such as the EU and Japan, pharmacovigilance requirements vary and aregenerally not as extensive, but there 
is a trend toward increasing regulation.Pfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTSPricing and Reimbursement
. Certain governments, including the different EU member states, the U.K., China, Japan, Canada, South Korea and some otherinternational markets, prov
ide healthcare at low-to-zero direct cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power as large single payers toregulate pharmaceutical pr
ices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system, particularly under recentglobal financing pressures.
 Governments may use a variety of cost-containment measures for our pharmaceutical products, including price cuts, mandatoryrebates, health technology assessment
s, forced localization as a condition of market access, “international reference pricing” (i.e., the practice of a countrylinking its regulated 
medicine prices to those of other countries), quality consistency evaluation processes and volume-based procurement. In addition, the international patchwork o
f price regulation and differing economic conditions and incomplete value assessments across countries has led to varying access toquality medicines in many markets
 and some third-party trade in our products between countries.In particular, internationa
l reference pricing adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and hinders patient access and innovation. Pricevariations, exacerbated by inte
rnational reference pricing systems, also have resulted from exchange rate fluctuations. The downward pricing pressure resultingfrom this dynamic can be expected to 
continue as a result of reforms to international reference pricing policies and measures targeting pharmaceuticals in someEuropean countries.
In addition, several impor
tant multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and
 Development, are increasing scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing reports and policy recommendations. In2019, the WHO continued exerting pres
sure on pharmaceutical pricing practices by supporting strategies to reduce medicine prices, including calling for greatertransparency around the cost of research and deve
lopment and production of medicines, as well as disclosure of net prices.In Japan, the pricing environment for 
innovative medicines further deteriorated in 2019 with the introduction of a health technology assessment (HTA) system toinform price adjustments of hea
lthcare technologies after launch. Expansion of this system for reimbursement decisions, as seen in other HTA markets, remainsa risk. While s
ignificant challenges remain, the 2020 Drug Pricing Reform Package, unlike the last reform package in 2018, is not expected to fundamentallychange the access landscape. Furthermore, the e
ligibility criteria for the Price Maintenance Premium, a key policy that protects against price erosion for certainproducts, is expected to be somewhat enhanced 
while expedited regulatory pathways are codified in law.In Canada, the P
atented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB) released draft guidelines to implement new pricing regulations in November 2019, which willgo into force in July 2020. These regu
lations drop the U.S. from the reference basket of countries used to determine price and add economic factors for settingceiling prices for new medicines. An
 initial analysis of the potential impact of these proposed changes to the PMPRB regulations estimated an approximately $26billion reduction 
in industry revenues over the next decade.China Pricing Pressures
. In China, healthcare is largely driven by a public payer system, with public medical insurance as the largest single payer forpharmaceuticals, and pric
ing pressures have increased in recent years. Government officials have consistently emphasized the importance of improved healthoutcomes, the need for healthcare reform and decrea
sed drug prices as key indicators of progress towards reform. While the government provides basic healthinsurance for the vast major
ity of Chinese citizens, that insurance is not adequate to cover many innovative medicines, and alternative funding sources forinnovative medicines remain sub
optimal.In 2019, China’s government negotiated 
with companies to add approximately 90 innovative drugs (mainly oncology medicines) to the National ReimbursementDrug List. This build
s on 60 drugs already added through negotiation in 2017 and 2018. Prices for drugs have been reduced dramatically through thisgovernment-led process. Wh
ile these negotiations have included a path to access for companies, market access is not assured. In addition, significant questionsabout the processes and negotiations for prov
incial tendering remain, as well as the need for multi-layered negotiations across provincial, municipal and hospitallevels.
In the off-patent space, in 2013, China began to imp
lement a quality consistency evaluation (QCE) process in order to improve the quality of domestically-manufactured generic drugs, prima
rily by requiring such drugs to pass a test to assess their bioequivalence to a qualified reference drug (typically the originatordrug). In 2018,
 numerous local generics were officially deemed bioequivalent under QCE. A pilot project for centralized volume-based procurement (VBP) wasthen initiated including 25 
molecules of drugs covering 11 major Chinese cities. Under this procurement model, a tender process has been established where acertain portion of included mo
lecule volumes are guaranteed to tender winners. The program is intended to contain healthcare costs by driving utilization ofgenerics that have 
passed QCE, which has resulted in dramatic price cuts for off-patent medicines.Upjohn and most off-
patent originators were not successful in the first bidding process under this pilot, which was finalized in December 2018 and implementedin March 2019, and most contracts went to 
local generic companies. The first bidding process resulted in significant price cuts by the successful bidders, withsome bidders reducing the pri
ce of their products by as much as 96 percent, as companies attempted to secure volumes on the Chinese pharmaceutical market.The drugs that lost the bidding were a
lso requested to reduce their selling price up to 30 percent based on the price difference with the successful bidder.China’s government began nation
wide expansion of the VBP pilot in December 2019. The expanded model, which is being implemented nationwide, applies tocertain drugs that 
are purchased for public hospitals as well as some military and private medical institutions. As in the first bidding process, our Upjohn businessunit and most originator brands 
were not successful inPfizer Inc.

or this nationwide expansion, and those contracts mostly went to local Chinese generic companies. The QCE-qualified generic makers ofatorvastatin and amlodipine b
id aggressively, lowering prices even further from the March 2019 tender. Our Upjohn business unit continues to take steps tomitigate the revenue impact of these 
initiatives but anticipates that they will continue to affect our Upjohn business in China in the future. We expect to utilize ourpresence in the retail channel, p
rivate hospitals and tendering capabilities to mitigate some of these pricing pressures. In addition, we believe that ourgeographic expansion to under-penetrated and lo
wer-tiered cities and counties and additional focus on non-tendered products will increase sales volumes ingreater China and p
artially mitigate pressures from QCE.In late 2019, China announced another round of expansion of the nat
ional VBP program, which covers 33 new molecules, including Biopharma’s Zithromaxtablets and Diflucan tablets and no 
Upjohn products. Biopharma was not successful in the bidding process for this expansion.Furthermore, the Chinese government has d
iscussed moving toward efforts to unify the reimbursement price between QCE-approved generic medicines and theapplicable original medicines. The
 government currently plans to implement this universal reimbursement price initiative within the next two to three years. If thispolicy is implemented, the n
ew reimbursement level for Upjohn’s products will likely be lower than the current reimbursement level, placing additional pressureson price and/or patient copays. There rema
ins uncertainty as to whether, when and how this policy may be officially implemented. The Chinese governmentcould also enact other polic
ies that may increase pricing pressures or have the effect of reducing the volume of sales available to Upjohn’s products. Thispotential policy, and any other po
licies like it that could increase pricing and copay pressures on Upjohn’s drug products in China, could have an adverse effecton our business, financial 
condition and results of operations. The government has indicated that additional post-LOE drugs could be subjected to QCEqualification in future round
s, which could also be tied to volume-based procurement. The scope of future QCE products and timing of any program expansion iscurrently unknown, making it
 difficult to determine the impact on Pfizer’s business and financial condition. We will continue to monitor the market fordevelopments.
EU Regulatory Changes
.  The EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation in May 2014, but its implementation has been delayed by the need for the EUauthorities to establish 
new technical systems. This regulation is aimed at simplifying and harmonizing the administrative processes and governance of clinicaltrials in the EU and will require increas
ed public posting of clinical trial results. It is currently not anticipated to be fully implemented until the first half of 2022 atthe earliest.
Brexit
. In June 2016, the U.K. electorate voted in a referendum to leave the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The U.K. left the EU on January 31, 2020 with status quo arrangements through a trans
ition period scheduled to end on December 31, 2020. The consequences of the U.K. leaving the EU and theterms of the future trading relationsh
ip continue to be highly uncertain, which may pose certain implications to our research, commercial and general businessoperations in the U.K. and the EU, 
including the approval and supply of our products. However, both the U.K. and the EU have issued detailed guidance for theindustry on how medicines, m
edical devices and clinical trials will be separately regulated in their respective territories. Pfizer has substantially completed itspreparations for Brexit, hav
ing made the changes necessary to meet relevant regulatory requirements in the EU and the U.K., through the transition period andafterwards, especiall
y in the regulatory, research, manufacturing and supply chain areas. Between 2018 and 2021, we expect to spend up to approximately $60million in one-time costs to make
 these adaptations. For additional informatio n on Brexit, see the Overview of Our Performance, Ope rating Environment,Strategy and Outlook
— The Global Economic Environment section in our 2019  Financial Report . China Regulatory Changes
.  In an effort to encourage drug innovation and reduce backlogs for existing applications for drug approval, in recent years, the NMPAhas unveiled numerous r
eform initiatives for China’s drug approval system and engaged in significant efforts to build its capabilities. The NMPA divides drugsinto new drugs and generics, w
ith the definition for new drugs changed from “China New” to “Global New.” This means that drugs previously approved in othermarkets (such as the U.S. or Eu
rope) are not considered new drugs under China’s regulatory regime. This change in definition creates more opportunities forChina’s domestic drug manuf
acturers than for multinational firms, because multinational firms have historically had significant competitive advantage insuccessfully achie
ving regulatory approvals for drugs first approved outside of China. Revisions in 2019 made clear, however, that regulatory approval from theFDA or the EMA would no longe
r be required for approval of imported drugs, though a notable exception persists for imported vaccines, which still require priorapproval from a reference regulator
y agency such as the FDA. In 2019, China published a revision to its Drug Administration Law and introduced a “marketingauthorization holder” syst
em, which grants the NMPA more authority over regulating manufacturers and provides manufacturers more flexibility in contractmanufacturing arrangements and manufactur
ing site transfers.While challenges re
main, a number of other policy changes are streamlining and accelerating approvals of domestic and imported drugs in China. Thesereforms, along with Ch
ina’s June 2018 elevation to the ICH Management Committee, are expected to pave the way for integration of Chinese regulations withglobal practices. These c
hanges include introducing more streamlined processes for maintaining renewal of product registrations, reduction in importing testingrequirements, and establish
ing an expedited registration pathway for drugs to treat rare diseases and serious, life-threatening illnesses with no effectivetreatment. Though certain details on i
mplementation are unclear (e.g., evolving list of qualified rare diseases and no guidance on what qualifies as serious, lifethreatening), the NMPA aims to bu
ild expedited pathways for certain categories of products similar to the U.S. and European regulatory systems. Additionally,the NMPA published chang
es to China’s registration requirements that align more with international practices, including a 60-day review timeline for clinical trialauthorizations and

ency and Disclosures. A number of countries have implemented laws requiring (or their industry associations have recommended)disclosure of transfers of va
lue made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers. For example, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industriesand Associations’ disclosure code
 requires all members, including Pfizer, to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations.Intellectual Property
.  The World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (WTO-TRIPS) required participantcountries to amend their intel
lectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005, with an extension until 2033 for least-developed countries. Whi
le we still face patent grant, enforcement and other intellectual property challenges around the world, some countries have madeimprovements. We inc
lude stronger patent protection among the factors we consider for continued business expansion in other participant countries.While the global intellectual pro
perty environment has generally improved following WTO-TRIPS and bilateral/multilateral trade agreements, our future businessgrowth depends on further progress in 
intellectual property protection. In emerging market countries in particular, governments have used intellectual propertypolicies as a tool to forc
e innovators to accept less than fair value for medicines, as well as to protect their local pharmaceutical industries. Considerable politicaland economic pressure exist
s to weaken current intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection, which has led to policiessuch as more restricti
ve standards for obtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions, restrictions on patentingcertain types of inventions (e.g., ne
w medical treatment methods), revocation of patents, laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue acompulsory license, 
weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection. Our industry advocacy efforts focus onseeking a more balanced busines
s environment for foreign manufacturers, as well as on underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems forlocal innovative industries and
 helping improve patients’ access to innovative medicines. In developed countries as well, including the EU, we are facing anincreasingly challenging intellectual pr
operty environment.As part of the Canada/EU Comprehens
ive Economic & Trade Agreement (CETA), Canada now provides sui generis  protection, commonly referred to a s patentterm restoration, for patent term extens
ions for basic patents; however, the extension is capped at two years, whereas the international norm is five years. Inaddition, the implementing regu
lations may create obstacles for patentees applying for patent term restoration via a Certificate of Supplementary Protection(CSP), and Canada’s proposed d
rug pricing reforms may negatively impact the benefit of a CSP. Furthermore, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement(USMCA) will, when implemented, require Cana
da and Mexico to make certain improvements to their current intellectual property regimes, including theestablishment of patent term adjustment fo
r unreasonable delays in the grant of patents.In China, the intellectual p
roperty environment has improved in recent years, although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas ofconcern. The government has taken steps to protect 
intellectual property rights in conformity with World Trade Organization provisions, although China remainedon the U.S. Trade Representative’
s Priority Watch List for 2019 due to ongoing enforcement challenges and China’s failure to make certain structural reforms.Further, the standards for patentability 
in China remain more restrictive than in other major markets, including the U.S., Europe and Japan. Also, while aframework exists for prote
cting patents for 20 years, enforcement mechanisms are often lacking or inconsistent. For example, the absence of effective patentlinkage mechanisms and pre
liminary injunctions, impractical evidentiary burdens, and heightened sufficiency standards have been used to invalidate patents atthe enforcement stage. In 2019, the regulatory authority g
ranted marketing approval to generic products while the reference product in each case are still subjectto patent protection, and there is no effective 
legal means to resolve patent disputes prior to the marketing of those infringing drugs. The U.S. and China recentlysigned an initial agreement 
in which China has committed to address some patent-related concerns, and both governments have indicated that they will continuebilateral discussions on implementa
tion of these commitments and other intellectual property issues in 2020.In Brazil and other L
atin American countries, the role of health regulatory authorities in reviewing patents (e.g., National Health Surveillance Agency in Brazil),restrictive patentabil
ity rules, ambiguity regarding the term of certain patents and backlogs at patent agencies may limit our ability to protect our products throughpatents. The lack of regulatory data protect
ion and difficulties in protecting certain types of inventions, such as new medical uses of drug products, may limit thecommercial lifespan of some p
harmaceutical products. Additionally, an increased threat of issuance of compulsory licenses for biopharmaceutical productsexists, which adds to busin
ess uncertainty.In India, we have seen some progress 
in terms of expediting patent approval processes to reduce pendency rates and implementing training programs toenhance enforcement. Despite these posit
ive steps, gaps remain in terms of addressing longstanding intellectual property concerns. For example, policiesfavoring compulsory l
icensing of patents, the tendency of thePfizer Inc.
2019 Form 10-K 19 
TABLE OF CONTENTSIndian Patent Office to revoke pharmaceut
ical patents in opposition proceedings (both pre- and post-grant), and restrictive standards for patentability ofpharmaceutical products have made 
it difficult to safeguard many of our inventions and our investments in innovation. These policies heighten the risk ofadditional patent challenges target
ing innovative pharmaceutical products, especially in areas perceived as being important to the public health of the population.Challenges against Pfi
zer patents in India are ongoing.Data Privacy. 
Outside of the U.S., many countries where we conduct business, including the EU, have privacy and data security laws and regulations concerningthe collection and use
 of personal data, and we must comply with these laws and regulations as well. One applicable law is the EU’s General Data ProtectionRegulation (GDPR). The G
DPR imposes detailed obligations on companies that collect, use, or otherwise process personal data and penalties fornoncompliance may inc
lude fines of up to 4 percent of the company’s global annual revenue. Additionally, the legislative and regulatory framework for privacyand data protec
tion issues worldwide is rapidly evolving as countries continue to adopt privacy and data security laws. Any inability to comply with applicablelaws, regulations, policies, industry
 standards or other legal obligations regarding data protection or privacy could result in additional costs and liability to Pfizeras well as reputational harm
 and may adversely affect our business.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Most of our operations are affected by nationa
l, state and/or local environmental laws. We have made, and intend to continue to make, the expendituresnecessary for compliance with 
applicable laws. We also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites. See the Notesto Consolidated Financial St
atements—Note 16 A3 . Contingencies and Certain Commitments— Legal Proceedings––Commercial and Other Matters in our 2019 Financial Report. As a re
sult, we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2019  for environmental compl iance purposes and for the clean-up of certainpast industrial activity as follows:
•
environment-related capital expenditures— $31 million ; and •
other environment-related expenses— $136 million . While capital expenditures or 
operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have amaterial effect on o
ur capital expenditures or competitive position.Climate change presents r
isks to our operations, including the potential for additional regulatory requirements and associated costs, and the potential for morefrequent and severe weather events and water ava
ilability challenges that may impact our facilities and those of our suppliers. For example, in 2017, ourmanufacturing and commercia
l operations in Puerto Rico were impacted by hurricanes as our three manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico sustained damage andbecame inoperable du
e to issues impacting Puerto Rico overall. All three sites resumed operations, and remediation activities were completed in 2018. Wecannot provide assurance that physi
cal risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future; however, we have a program forreviewing our vulnerab
ility to potential weather-related risks and other natural disasters and we update our assessments periodically. To date, we haveconcluded that, because of our facil
ity locations, our existing distribution networks and our controls, we do not anticipate that these risks will have a materialimpact on Pfizer in the 
near term.TAX MATTERS

: MANAGED CARE TRENDS
Private third-party payer
s, such as health plans, and other managed care entities, such as PBMs, continue to take action to manage the utilization of drugs andcontrol the cost of drugs. Consol
idation among MCOs has increased the negotiating power of MCOs and other private third-party payers. Private third-partypayers, as well as governme
nts, increasingly employ formularies to control costs by taking into account discounts in connection with decisions about formularyinclusion or favorable fo
rmulary placement. Failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or favorable formulary placement for our products, or failureto obtain such form
ulary placement at favorable pricing, could adversely impact revenue. Private third-party payers often implement formularies with copaymenttiers to encourage utilizat
ion of certain drugs and have also been raising co-payments required from beneficiaries, particularly for branded pharmaceuticals andbiotechnology products
. Private third-party payers are also implementing new initiatives like so-called “copay accumulators” (policies that provide that the valueof copay assistance does not count as out-of-po
cket costs that are applied toward deductibles) that can shift more of the cost burden to manufacturers andpatients. This cost shifting ha
s increased consumer interest and input in medication choices, as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and maycause consumers to f
avor lower cost generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals. Third-party payers also use additional measures such as new-to-marketblocks, exclusion lists, indication-base
d pricing, and value-based pricing/contracting to improve their cost containment efforts, and are also increasingly imposingutilization management t
ools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring thepatient to first fail on one or more gene
ric products before permitting access to a branded medicine. As the U.S. private third-party payer market consolidatesfurther and as more drugs become avai
lable in generic form, biopharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payers,who will continue to drive more 
of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives.GENERIC COMPETITION
Competition from manufacturer
s of generic drugs is a major challenge for our branded products around the world, and the loss or expiration of intellectualproperty rights can have a sign
ificant adverse effect on our revenues. In addition, our patented products may face generic competition before patent exclusivityexpires, including upon the “at
-risk” launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product) by a manufacturer of a generic version ofone of our patented products. Generic competit
ion could lead to our loss of a major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. A numberof our products have experienced sign
ificant generic competition over the last few years. For example, Lyrica (a product in our Upjohn business) lost patentprotection in the U.S. in June 2019 and mu
lti-source generic competition began in July 2019. Also, the basic product patent for Chantix in the U.S. will expire inNovember 2020. In China, we are expe
cted to face further intensified competition by certain generic manufacturers, which may result in price cuts and volumeloss of some of our products.
Also, generic manufacturers ha
ve filed applications with the FDA seeking approval of product candidates that such companies claim do not infringe our patentsor that our patents are not valid; these inc
lude candidates that would compete with, among other products, Eliquis, Ibrance and Xeljanz. Our licensing andcollaboration partners al
so face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering products for which we have licenses or co-promotion rights. Inaddition, our patent-protected products may fa
ce competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity.Pfizer Inc.
2019 Form 10-K 22 
TABLE OF CONTENTSCOMPETITIVE PRODUCTS
We cannot predict with accu
racy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products, including new product entrants, in-line branded products,generic products, private labe
l products, biosimilars and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our in-line drugs anddrug candidates. The introduction of compet
itive products can result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products indevelopment, as well as unant
icipated product obsolescence. Competitive product launches have occurred in recent years, and certain potentially competitiveproducts are in various stages of de
velopment. Some of these have been filed for approval with the FDA and with regulatory authorities in other countries.We also produce generic 
and biosimilar pharmaceutical products that compete with products from competitors, including other generic and biosimilarmanufacturers. The ability to 
launch a generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical product at or before the anticipated formation of the generic or biosimilar marketplaceis important to that
 product’s profitability. With increasing competition in the generic or biosimilar product markets, our success will depend on our ability to bringnew products to market quick
ly. The FDA, along with other regulatory agencies around the world, has been experiencing a backlog of generic drug applications,which may result in delayed a
pprovals of new generic products over the next few years. Also, we may face access challenges for our biosimilar products whereour product may not receive appropr
iate coverage/reimbursement access or remains in a disadvantaged position relative to the innovator product. For example,Inflectra has experienc
ed access challenges among commercial payers. In September 2017, Pfizer filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District ofPennsylvania against Johns
on & Johnson (J&J) alleging that J&J’s exclusionary contracts and other anticompetitive practices concerning Remicade® (infliximab)violate federal antitrust
 laws.DEPENDENCE ON KEY IN-LINE PRODUCTS
We recorded direct product and/or a
lliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of eight biopharmaceutical products in 2019: Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13,Ibrance, Eliquis, Lyrica, Xeljanz,
 Lipitor, Enbrel and Chantix/Champix. Those products accounted for 49%  of our total revenues in 2019 . If these products or any of our other major products were to beco
me subject to problems such as loss of patent protection (if applicable), changes in prescription growth rates, materialproduct liability 
litigation, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings, publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence, pressure from existing competitiveproducts, changes in labeling, p
ricing and access pressures, supply shortages or, if a new, more effective treatment should be introduced, the adverse impact onour revenues could be signif
icant. A number of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in thelast few years, and patents cover
ing a number of our best-selling medicines are, or have been, the subject of pending legal challenges. For example, as a resultof a patent litigation settlement, Teva 
Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. launched a generic version of Viagra (a product in our Upjohn business) in the U.S. inDecember 2017. In addition, Lyri
ca (a product in our Upjohn business) lost patent protection in the U.S. in June 2019 and multi-source generic competitionbegan in July 2019. Also, the basi
c product patent for Chantix in the U.S. will expire in November 2020. In addition, our revenues could be significantly impactedby the timing and rate of commerc
ial acceptance of key new products. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business––Patents and Other Intel lectualProperty Rights 
section in this 2019  Form 10-K. Further, our All iance revenues will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and co-promotion agreements that we have entered into and that 
we may enter into from time to time.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT
The discovery and development of safe, effect
ive new products, as well as the development of additional uses for existing products, are necessary for thecontinued strength of our businesses. Our p
roduct lines must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their marketexclusivity, as 
well as to provide for earnings growth. Our growth potential depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or newindications for exist
ing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers, either through internal R&D or throughcollaborations, acquis
itions, joint ventures or licensing or other arrangements with third parties. However, balancing current growth, investment for future growthand the delivery of shareholder retu
rn remains a major challenge. The average costs of product development continue to rise, as do the regulatory requirementsin many therapeutic areas, wh
ich may affect the number of candidates funded as well as the sustainability of the R&D portfolio. Our ongoing investments in newproduct introductions and in R
&D for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth.Additionally, our R
&D investment plans and resources may not be correctly matched between science and markets, and failure to invest in the right technologyplatforms, therapeutic segments, produ
ct classes, geographic markets and/or in-licensing and out-licensing opportunities could adversely impact the productivityof our pipeline. Further, even if the area
s with the greatest market attractiveness are identified, the scientific approach may not succeed for any given programdespite the significant in
vestment required for R&D, and the commercial potential of the product may not be as competitive as expected because of the highlydynamic market environment and the hu
rdles in terms of access and reimbursement.We continue to strengthen our global 
R&D organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in R&D to achieve asustainable pipeline that 
is positioned to deliver value in the near-term and over time. These strategies may not deliver the desired result, which could affectgrowth and profitability in 
the future.Pfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTSBIOSIMILARS
Abbreviated legal pathways fo
r the approval of biosimilars exist in many international markets and, since the passage of the ACA, a framework for such approvalexists in the U.S. If compet
itors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biologic products, our biologic products may become subjectto competition from t
hese biosimilars, with attendant competitive pressure, and price reductions could follow. For example, Enbrel faces ongoing biosimilarcompetition in most European ma
rkets. The loss of patent rights, due to patent expiration or litigation, could trigger competition.We are developing and
 commercializing biosimilar medicines. Risks related to our commercialization of biosimilars include the potential for steeper thananticipated price erosion 
due to increased competitive intensity, coupled with intellectual property challenges that may preclude timely commercialization of ourpotential biosimilar products. 
There is also a risk of lower uptake for biosimilars due to various factors that may vary for different biosimilars (e.g., anti-competitive practices, physician r
eluctance to prescribe biosimilars for existing patients taking the originator product, or misaligned financial incentives). See alsothe 
Competitive Products risk factor above. RESEARCH STUDIES
Decisions about research 
studies made early in the development process of a drug or vaccine candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketingstrategy and payer reimbursement pos
sibilities if it receives regulatory approval. For example, a wider range of studies can lead to approval for a broader set ofindications that may impa
ct the marketing and payer reimbursement process. However, each additional indication and its reimbursement potential must bebalanced against the time and resource
s required to demonstrate benefit, the increased complexity of development and manufacturing and the potential delaysto approval of the lead indication. 
We try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably anticipate and address challenges, but there is no guarantee that anoptimal balance between tria
l conduct, speed and desired outcome will be achieved each time. The degree to which such potential challenges are foreseen andadequately addressed could affect our future re
sults.INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
Our international operations cou
ld be affected by currency fluctuations, capital and exchange controls, economic conditions, expropriation and other restrictivegovernment actions, changes in inte
llectual property legal protections and remedies, trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval,production, pricing, and market
ing of, reimbursement for and access to our products, as well as by political unrest, unstable governments and legal systems andinter-governmental disputes. 
Any of these changes could adversely affect our business.Many emerging markets have exper
ienced growth rates in excess of developed markets, leading to an increased contribution to the industry’s globalperformance. As a result, we have been e
mploying strategies to grow in emerging markets. However, our strategies in emerging markets may not be successfuland these countries may not continue to susta
in these growth rates. For example, even though China is growing faster than most emerging markets, we facecertain challenges in China d
ue to government imposed pricing controls affecting certain Pfizer medicines. In addition, some emerging market countries may beparticularly vulnerable to perio
ds of financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending.Even though we cons
tantly monitor the evolving emerging markets for any unanticipated risk to Pfizer, certain financial or political events in such markets canadversely affect our results.
SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS
Specialty pharmaceuticals are m
edicines that treat rare or life-threatening conditions that typically have smaller patient populations. The growing availability anduse of innovative specialt
y pharmaceuticals, combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, has generatedpayer interest in developing 
cost-containment strategies targeted to this sector. The impact of payers’ efforts to control access to and pricing of specialtypharmaceuticals is increasing. A 
number of factors create a more challenging paradigm for Pfizer given our growing specialty business portfolio such asformulary restrict
ions and increasing use of utilization management tools such as step edits, which can lead to higher negotiated rebates or discounts to healthplans and PBMs in the U.S., as 
well as the increasing use of health technology assessments and government pressures in markets around the world.PRODUCT MANUFACTURING, SALES AND MARKETING RISKS
Difficulties or de
lays in product manufacturing, sales or marketing could affect future results through regulatory actions, shut-downs, work stoppages or strikes,approval delays, withdrawals, rec
alls, penalties, supply disruptions, shortages or stock-outs, reputational harm, product liability or unanticipated costs. Examplesof such difficulties or de
lays include, but are not limited to, the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand; the failure to predict marketdemand for, or to gain market acceptance of, approved p
roducts; the possibility that the supply of component materials is delayed or unavailable and that thequality of such material
s are substandard and not detected; the possibility that we may fail to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout our internal andexternal supply network a
nd/or comply with cGMPs and other applicable regulations such as serialization (which allows for track and trace of products in thesupply chain to enhance patient safety);

 and commercial operations as a result of natural (including hurricanes, earthquakes and floods) or man-made disasters (includingarson or terrorist attacks) at ou
r facilities or at a supplier or vendor, including those that may be related to climate change; failure to maintain the integrity of oursupply chains against econom
ic adulteration, product diversion, product theft, counterfeit goods and cyberattacks. As an example, we have been experiencingproduction issues with Genot
ropin that will decrease revenue from that product.Regulatory agencies periodically insp
ect our drug manufacturing facilities to evaluate compliance with cGMP or other applicable requirements. Failure to complywith these requirements may 
subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product,injunctions, debarment, reca
ll of a product, delays or denials of product approvals, import bans or denials of import certifications, any of which could have amaterial adverse effect on our bus
iness, financial condition and results of operations. In February 2017, for example, we received a warning letter from the FDAcommunicating the FDA’s view tha
t certain violations of cGMP regulations exist at Hospira’s manufacturing facility in McPherson, Kansas. We undertookcorrective actions to addres
s the concerns raised by the FDA. In January 2018, the FDA upgraded the status of Pfizer’s McPherson manufacturing facility to VAIbased on an October 2017 inspection. The change to VAI statu
s lifted the compliance hold that the FDA placed on approval of pending applications. In June2018, the FDA informed us that it had comp
leted an evaluation of corrective actions and closed out the February 2017 warning letter issued to our McPhersonmanufacturing facility afte
r determining that we had addressed the violations contained in the warning letter. In July-August 2018, the FDA conducted a follow-upinspection of our McPherson fac
ility and issued an inspection report noting several findings. Pfizer responded to the FDA’s findings, and is in the process ofimplementing a correct
ive and preventive action plan to address the FDA’s concerns. On the basis of the July-August 2018 FDA inspection, the FDA changedthe inspection classification o
f the McPherson site to Official Action Indicated (OAI). Future FDA inspections and regulatory activities will further assess theadequacy and sustainability of the
se corrections implemented at the site. Communication with the FDA on the status of the McPherson site is ongoing. As aresult of the current OAI class
ification, the FDA may refuse to grant premarket approval of applications and/or the FDA may refuse to grant export certificatesrelated to products manufactured at our McPhe
rson site until the site status is upgraded, which upgrade would be based on a re-inspection by the FDA. Wehave been experiencing shortages of product
s from the legacy Hospira portfolio, among others, largely driven by capacity constraints, technical issues, supplierquality concerns or una
nticipated increases in demand. We have made considerable progress in remediating issues at legacy Hospira facilities manufacturingsterile injectable
s and have substantially improved supply from most of these sites. Continuing product shortage interruption at these manufacturing facilitiescould negatively impact our
 financial results.In addition, in September 2017, Merid
ian Medical Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc., received a warning letter from the FDA asserting the FDA’s viewthat certain violations o
f cGMP and Quality System Regulations exist at Meridian’s manufacturing sites in St. Louis, Missouri and classifying the site as OAI.Meridian responded to the warning 
letter and committed to making improvements across the sites. We have made considerable progress addressing theconcerns raised by the
 FDA, and communication with the FDA is ongoing. Future FDA inspections and regulatory activities will further assess the adequacy andsustainability of these co
rrections implemented at the site. As a result of the OAI classification, the FDA may refuse to grant premarket approval of applicationsand/or the FDA may refuse to grant export cert
ificates related to products manufactured at our St. Louis sites.COLLABORATIONS AND OTHER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES
We depend on third-party collabo
rators, service providers, and others in the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of our products andproduct candidates and also enter into 
joint ventures and other business development transactions in connection with our business. To achieve expected longerterm benefits, we may make substant
ial upfront payments in such transactions, which may negatively impact our reported earnings. We rely heavily on theseparties for multiple aspe
cts of our drug development, manufacturing and commercialization activities, but we do not control many aspects of those activities. Wealso outsource certain serv
ices to other parties, including transaction processing, accounting, information technology, manufacturing, clinical trial recruitment andexecution, clinical lab services, no
n-clinical research, safety services, integrated facilities management and other areas. Failure by one or more of these thirdparties to complete activ
ities on schedule or in accordance with our expectations; failure by one or more of these parties to meet their contractual or otherobligations to Pfizer; fa
ilure of one or more of these parties to comply with applicable laws or regulations; or any disruption in the relationships between Pfizerand one or more of these third parties, cou
ld delay or prevent the development, approval, manufacturing or commercialization of our products and productcandidates, could exp
ose us to suboptimal quality of service delivery or deliverables, could result in repercussions such as missed deadlines or other timelinessissues, erroneous data and supply d
isruptions, and could also result in non-compliance with legal or regulatory requirements or industry standards orreputational harm, all with 
potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business.BIOPHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALERS
In 
2019, our largest biopharm aceutical wholesaler accounted for approximately 16%  of our total revenues (and approximately 32%  of our total U.S. revenues),and our top three biopharmaceutical 
wholesalers accounted for approximately 37%  of our total revenues (and approximately 79%  of our total U.S. revenues). Ifone of our significant biopharma
ceutical wholesalers should encounter financial or other difficulties, such wholesaler might decrease the amount of business thatit does with us, and we
 might be unable to collect all the amounts that the wholesaler owes us on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impactPfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTSour results of opera
tions. In addition, we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers will increase competitive and pricingpressures on pharmaceutical 
manufacturers, including us.BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
We expect to continue to enhance our in-
line products and product pipeline through various forms of business development, which can include alliances,licenses, joint ventures, collab
orations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, divestments, mergers and acquisitions. However, these enhancementplans are subject to the availab
ility and cost of appropriate opportunities, competition from other pharmaceutical companies that are seeking similar opportunitiesand our ability to successfu
lly identify, structure and execute transactions, including the ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of announced transactions inthe anticipated timeframes or at a
ll, and successfully integrate acquisitions. Pursuing these opportunities may require us to obtain additional equity or debtfinancing, and could result 
in increased leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings. Where we acquire debt or equity securities as all or part of theconsideration for business de
velopment activities, such as in connection with our contribution agreement entered into with Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., the valueof those securities will fluctuat
e, and may depreciate in value. We may not control the company in which we acquire securities, such as in connection with adivestiture or collaborative arr
angement, and as a result, we will have limited ability to determine its management, operational decisions and policies. Further,while we seek to mitigate risks an
d liabilities of such transactions through, among other things, due diligence, there may be risks and liabilities that such duediligence efforts fail to d
iscover, that are not disclosed to us, or that we inadequately assess. Legal proceedings or regulatory issues often arise as a result ofactivities that occurred at a
cquired companies, their partners and other third parties. In 2016, for example, we paid $784.6 million to resolve allegations related toWyeth’s reporting of pri
ces to the government with respect to Protonix for activities that occurred prior to our acquisition of Wyeth. For these and other reasons,we may not realize the antic
ipated benefits of such transactions, and expected synergies and accretion may not be realized within the expected timeframes, orat all.
COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS
A counterfeit medicine i
s one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source. A counterfeit Pfizer medicine, therefore, is onemanufactured by someone other than Pfizer, but 
which appears to be the same as an authentic Pfizer medicine. The prevalence of counterfeit medicines is asignificant and growing 
industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the widespread use of the Internet, which hasgreatly facilitated the ease by 
which counterfeit medicines can be advertised, purchased and delivered to individual patients; the availability of sophisticatedtechnology that makes it easier fo
r counterfeiters to make counterfeit medicines; the growing involvement in the medicine supply chain of under-regulatedwholesalers and repackagers
; the lack of adequate inspection at certain international postal facilities as counterfeit medicines are increasingly delivered direct tocustomers in small pa
rcel packages; the tendency to misuse and abuse medicines; and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters comparedto the large profits that can be earned by them from the 
sale of counterfeit medicines. Further, laws against pharmaceutical counterfeiting vary greatly fromcountry to country,
 and the enforcement of existing law varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, in some countries, pharmaceuticalcounterfeiting is not a cri
me; in others, it may result in only minimal sanctions. In addition, those involved in the distribution of counterfeit medicines use complextransport routes in order to evade custom
s controls by disguising the true source of their products.Pfizer’s global reputation mak
es its medicines prime targets for counterfeiting organizations. Counterfeit medicines continue to pose a significant risk to patienthealth and safety because of the conditions under 
which they are manufactured—often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites—as well asthe lack of regulation of their content
s. Counterfeiters have been recently evolving to counterfeit life sustaining medications such as oncology medicines. Thisshift significantly increases the
 risk to patients who, for instance, unsuspectingly purchase counterfeit oncology medications from illicit online “pharmacies”operated by criminal counterfe
iting organizations. Failure to mitigate this new threat posed by counterfeit biopharma medicines could adversely impact ourbusiness, by, among other things, caus
ing the loss of patient confidence in the Pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines, potentially resulting in lostsales, product recalls, and an 
increased threat of litigation.We have an enterprise-wide 
strategy to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit medicines, and focused on educating patients and health careproviders to reduce demand through awarene
ss; increasing engagement and education of global law enforcement, customs and regulatory agencies about thegrowing prevalence of co
unterfeit life sustaining medicines; enhancing online identification and disruption efforts in partnership with pharmaceutical associationsto optimize resources and i
mpact; educating legislators about the risk to the security of the international drug supply chain by illicit manufacturing and distributionnetworks operated by transnational 
criminal organizations; supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecute counterfeiters; assessing new andexisting technologies to see
k to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy our products and easier for patients and healthcare providers to distinguishauthentic from counterfeit medic
ines; and using data analytics and risk assessment tools to better target the factors that give rise to the counterfeiting problem inthe first place. However, ou
r efforts and the efforts of others may not be entirely successful, and the presence of counterfeit medicines may continue to increase.Pfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTSRISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
: PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT
U.S. and international governmenta
l regulations that mandate price controls and limitations on patient access to our products or establish prices paid bygovernment entities or programs fo
r our products impact our business, and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations orpolicies.
In the U.S., many of our products are subje
ct to increasing pricing pressures. Pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to enhanced government and publicscrutiny and calls for 
reform. Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, pharmaceutical price controls or patient access constraints underthe Medicaid program, and some states a
re considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. There have also been 
recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costsor limiting drug prices. Efforts
 by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, includinglegislation on drug impo
rtation, could adversely affect our business if implemented. See the discussion regarding pricing and reimbursement in the Item 1. Business
— Government Regulation and Price Constraints— In the United States— Pricing and Reimbursement section  in this 2019  Form 10-K. We encounter similar 
regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries. In certain international markets, such as the different EU member states, the U.K.,China, Japan, Canada and South Korea, government
s have significant power as large single payers to regulate prices, access criteria (e.g., through public orprivate health technology asses
sments), or other means of cost control, particularly under recent global financing pressures. As a result, we expect thatpressures on the pricing component of ope
rating results will continue. For example, China, in 2013, began to implement a QCE process, under which numerouslocal generics have offi
cially been deemed bioequivalents of a qualified reference drug. China’s government subsequently initiated a pilot project for centralizedVBP in 2018, which inc
luded 25 molecules of drugs and covered 11 major Chinese cities. Under this procurement model, a tender process was establishedwhereby a certain portion of in
cluded molecule volumes were guaranteed to tender winners. This tender process was intended to contain healthcare costs bydriving utilizat
ion of generics and bioequivalents that had passed QCE, and has resulted in dramatic price cuts for off-patent medicines. China’s governmentbegan nationwide expansion of the VBP p
ilot in December 2019. See the discussion regarding these government initiatives in China in the Item 1. Business
— Government Regulation and Price Constraints— Outside the United States— China Pricing Pressures section in this 2019 Form 10-K. We anticipatethat these initiatives w
ill continue to increase pricing pressures on our drug products in China in the future.The adoption of
 restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions or more restrictive ones in existing jurisdictions or the failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequatepricing could also adversely impact
 revenue. In our vaccines business, we participate in a tender process in many countries for participation in nationalimmunization programs. Failure 
to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adverselyaffect our business.
U.S. HEALTHCARE REFORM
The U.S. healthcare industry 
is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. For example, the ACA was enacted by Congress in March2010 and established a major expans
ion of healthcare coverage, financed in part by a number of new rebates, discounts, and taxes that had a significant effecton our expenses and profitabilit
y. See the discussion in the Item 1. Business — Government Regulation and Price Constraints— In the United States section in this 2019 Form 10-K. We face uncerta
inties due to federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of theprovisions of the ACA. Th
ere is additional uncertainty given the ruling in December 2019 by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Texas v. Azar that the individual mandate, wh
ich is a significant provision of the ACA, is unconstitutional. The case has been remanded to a lower court to determine whetherthe individual mandate is 
inseparable from the entire ACA, in which case the ACA as a whole would be rendered unconstitutional. In the meantime, theremaining provision
s of the law remain in effect. The revenues generated for Pfizer by the health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion under the ACAare not material, so the impact of fu
ll invalidation of the law is expected to be limited. However, any future replacement of the ACA may adversely affect ourbusiness and financial results
, particularly if the legislation reduces incentives for employer-sponsored insurance coverage or dramatically increases industrytaxes and fees. Any future healthcare reform effo
rts may adversely affect our business and financial results.Other U.S. federal or state legi
slative or regulatory action and/or policy efforts could adversely affect our business, including, among others, general budgetcontrol actions, changes in patent 
laws, the importation of prescription drugs from outside the U.S. at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreigncountries (which is among th
e U.S. Presidential Administration’s policy proposals), revisions to reimbursement of biopharmaceuticals under governmentprograms (such as the imple
mentation of international reference pricing for Medicare Part B drugs, or changes to protected class criteria for Part D drugs),restrictions on U.S. direct-to-c
onsumer advertising, limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals, or the use of comparative effectivenessmethodologies that could be imp
lemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences amongpharmaceutical products 
and restricts access to innovative medicines.Pfizer Inc.
2019 Form 10-K 27 
TABLE OF CONTENTSU.S. ENTITLEMENT REFORM
In the U.S., government action to reduce federa
l spending on entitlement programs including Medicare and Medicaid may affect payment for our products orservices provided us
ing our products. The Congressional Budget Office routinely releases options for reducing federal spending, and the December 2018release includes proposa
ls to cap federal Medicaid payments to the states, and to require manufacturers to pay a minimum rebate on drugs covered underMedicare Part D for low-income b
eneficiaries. Significant Medicare reductions could also result if, for example, Congress proceeds with certain proposals toconvert the Medicare fee-for-ser
vice program into a premium support program, or Congress chooses to implement the recommendations made annually by theMedicare Payment Advisory Commission, which
 are primarily intended to extend the fiscal solvency of the Medicare program. These and any other significantspending reductions or cost contro
ls affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented could havean adverse impact on our results of ope
rations.SUBSTANTIAL REGULATION
We are subject to extensive, co
mplex, costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the U.S., principally by the FDA and theDEA, and foreign regula
tory authorities. Failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to operating restrictions and criminalprosecution, monetary
 penalties and other disciplinary actions, including, sanctions, warning letters, product seizures, recalls, fines, injunctions, suspension,revocation of approvals, corporate 
integrity or deferred prosecution agreements or exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs, aswell as reputational harm.
DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS
Innovation is critica
l to the success of our Company, and drug discovery and development are time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. The outcome of the lengthy and complex process of 
identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of risk and cost.The process from early dis
covery to design and adequate implementation of clinical trials to regulatory approval can take many years. Drug candidates can anddo fail at any stage of the process, inc
luding as the result of unfavorable pre-clinical and clinical trial results, or unfavorable new clinical data and furtheranalyses of existing c
linical data, including results that may not support further clinical development of the applicable product candidate or indication. We maynot be able to m
eet anticipated pre-clinical or clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for our pre-clinical or clinical trials, regulatorysubmission dates, regulator
y approval dates and/or launch dates. Similarly, we may not be able to successfully address all of the comments received fromregulatory authorities such a
s the FDA and the EMA, or obtain approval from regulators. Regulatory approval of drug or biologic products depends on myriadfactors, including a regulato
r making a determination as to whether a product’s benefits outweigh its known risks and a determination of the product’s efficacy.Additionally, cl
inical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments by regulatory authorities. Even after a drug or biologic is approved, it couldbe adversely affected by regulatory de
cisions impacting labeling, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters. We may not be able to receive ormaintain favorable recomme
ndations by technical or advisory committees, such as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices that may impact the useof our vaccines. Further, cla
ims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety and efficacy of in-line products and product candidates can result in a negativeimpact on product sales
, product recalls or withdrawals, and/or consumer fraud, product liability and other litigation and claims. Increasing regulatory scrutiny ofdrug safety and efficacy, with regu
latory authorities increasingly focused on product safety and the risk/benefit profile of products as they relate to already-approved products, has resulted in a mo
re challenging, expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process due to requests for, among other things, additional ormore extensive clin
ical trials prior to granting approval or increased post-approval requirements. For these and other reasons discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors
, we may not obtain the approvals we e xpect within the timeframe we anticipate, or at all.POST-APPROVAL DATA
As a condition to granting market
ing approval of a product, the FDA may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials. The results generated in thesePhase 4 trials could resu
lt in the loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of aproduct. Regulatory agencies 
in countries outside the U.S. often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirements. For example, in July andDecember 2019, the FDA updated the U.S. pres
cribing information for Xeljanz to include three additional boxed warnings as well as changes to the indicationand dosing for ulcera
tive colitis. In January 2020, the EMA revised the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for Xeljanz to include new warnings andrecommendations for use of Xel
janz due to an increased risk of venous thromboembolism and, due to an increased risk of infections, revised warnings inpatients older than 65 years of age. These updates we
re based on the FDA’s and EMA’s review of data from the ongoing post-marketing requirementrheumatoid arthritis study 
A3921133. Postmarketing studies, whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary,and other emerging data about marketed products, such a
s adverse event reports, may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of ourproducts. Further, the discovery of s
ignificant problems with a product similar to one of our products could implicate the entire class of products; and this, in turn,could have an advers
e effect on the availability or commercial viability of our product(s) as well as other products in the class.Pfizer Inc.

We and certain of our subsidia
ries are involved in various legal proceedings, including patent litigation, such as claims that our patents are invalid and/or do notcover the product of the generic drug manufacture
r or where one or more third parties seeks damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for allegedinfringement of its patents by our co
mmercial or other activities, product liability and other product-related litigation, including personal injury, consumer, off-labelpromotion, securities, ant
itrust and breach of contract claims, commercial, environmental, government investigations, employment, tax litigation and other legalproceedings, including va
rious means for resolving asbestos litigation, that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Litigation is inherentlyunpredictable, and excessive 
verdicts do occur. Although we believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, wecould in the future incur judgment
s, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments couldhave a material adverse effect on our re
sults of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which theamounts are paid.
Claims against our patents 
include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various products or processes. Although we believe we havesubstantial defenses to these chal
lenges with respect to all of our material patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters, and a loss inany of these cases could result 
in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and couldmaterially affect future
 results of operations.Like other pharmaceutical co
mpanies, we are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed markets and multipleemerging markets in which we o
perate. Criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicablejurisdictions, co
rporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements, as well as reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result fromgovernment investigations
 in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business. In addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines tointervene, the relator may sti
ll pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government.Our activities relat
ing to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the FFDCA, the Medicaid Drug RebateProgram, the FCPA and other federal and state 
statutes, including those discussed elsewhere in this 2019  Form 10-K, as well as an ti-kickback and false claimslaws, and similar laws in international jurisdictions
. Like many companies in our industry, we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and othertypes of information demands from gove
rnment authorities, and been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought bygovernmental authorities, as 
well as by consumers and private payers. In some instances, we have incurred significant expense, civil payments, fines and otheradverse consequences
 as a result of these claims, actions and inquiries. For example, these claims, actions and inquiries may relate to alleged failures toaccurately interpret or ident
ify or prevent non-compliance with the laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product information (approved andunapproved), potentially resu
lting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation. This risk may be heightened by digital marketing, including socialmedia, mobile applications an
d blogger outreach.In connection with the resolut
ion of a U.S. government investigation concerning independent copay assistance organizations that provide financial assistance toMedicare patients, in May 2018, 
we entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Healthand Human Services, which is ef

We and certain of o
ur subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to environmental claims andproceedings. 
Amounts recorded for legal and env ironmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertaintiesand can rely heavily on 
estimates and assumptions. While we have accrued for  worldwide environmental liabilities, there is no guarantee that additional costswill not be incurred be
yond the amounts accrued. If we fail to properly manage the safety of our facilities and the environmental risks associated therewith or ifwe are required to increase our a
ccruals for contingencies for environmental claims and proceedings in the future, it could potentially have an adverse effect onour results of operations.
RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
: PATENT PROTECTION
Our long-term success la
rgely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination ofintellectual property, 
including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality and licenseagreements, to protect our intellectua
l property and proprietary rights. If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not beable to prevent third parties from 
launching generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products, using our proprietary technologies or from marketing productsthat are very similar o
r identical to ours. Our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, or be granted on a timely basis.Similarly, any te
rm extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, our issued patents may not contain claims sufficientlybroad to protect
 us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particularproduct area. The scope of our patent claims a
lso may vary between countries, as individual countries have distinct patent laws. We may be subject tochallenges by third parties
 regarding our intellectual property, including, among others, claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term.Our ability to enforce our patents a
lso depends on the laws of individual countries and each country’s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual propertyrights, and the extent to which certa
in sovereigns may seek to engage in policies or practices that may weaken its intellectual property framework (e.g., laws orregulations that promote or provide b
road discretion to issue a compulsory license). In countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity, mechanismsexist permitting some for
m of challenge to our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of suchregulatory exclusivity, and g
eneric companies are increasingly employing aggressive strategies, such as “at risk” launches that challenge our patent rights. Mostof the suits involve cla
ims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products, processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover theproduct of the generic drug manufacturer. Independent act
ions have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respectto certain products constitute unfai
r competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. Such claims may also be brought as counterclaims to actions we bring toenforce our patents. We are also party to other patent da
mages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governmentsor other parties are seeking damages f
rom us for alleged delay of generic entry. We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review,post-grant review, re-exam
ination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreigncounterparts relating to our inte
llectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of our patents is found to be invalid in such proceedings,generic or competitive produ
cts could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several of the patentsin our pneumococcal vacc
ine portfolio were challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. In October 2017, the Patent Trialand Appeal Board (PTAB) refused to 
initiate proceedings as to two  patents. In June 2018, the PTAB ruled on another patent, holding that one claim was validand that all other claims 
were invalid. The party challenging that patent has appealed the decision. In November 2019, the Federal Circuit vacated the PTAB’sruling and requested that the PTAB redec
ide the challenge. In March and June 2019, an additional patent was found invalid in separate proceedings by thePTAB. We have appealed. Chal
lenges to other patents remain pending in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The invalidation of all of these patents in ourpneumococcal portfolio co
uld potentially allow a competitor pneumococcal vaccine into the marketplace. Further, if we are unable to maintain our existinglicense agreements or other agreement
s pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, including because such agreements expire or areterminated, our op
erating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Likewise, in the U.S. and othe
r countries, we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending, any of which may be thesubject of a governmental or third
-party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark. As our products mature, our reliance onour trademarks and trade dress to different
iate us from our competitors increases and as a result, if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting,registering or using trad
emarksPfizer Inc.
2019 Form 10-K 30 
TABLE OF CONTENTSand trade dress that infringe, dilute o
r otherwise violate our trademark rights, our business could be materially adversely affected. We actively seek to protect ourproprietary information, 
including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties toexecute proprietary informat
ion and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment, engagement or other relationship. Despite theseefforts and precautions, we may be unable to p
revent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectualproperty without authorization, and 
legal remedies in some countries may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use.Further, others may
 independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternativedesigns or processes or 
otherwise.THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS
A properly functioning int
ellectual property regime is essential to our business model. We are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights ofother companies, but the patent granting process 
is imperfect. Accordingly, the pursuit of valid busines s opportunities may require us to challenge intellectualproperty rights held by
 other companies that we believe were improperly granted. Such challenges may include negotiation and litigation, which may not alwaysbe successful.
Part of our business depends upon succes
sfully identifying generic pharmaceutical product and biosimilar opportunities and launching products to takeadvantage of those opportunities, which 
may involve litigation, associated costs and time delays, and may ultimately not be successful. These opportunities mayarise in situations 
where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired, where patents have been declared invalid, or where products do notinfringe the patents of others, and in some c
ircumstances we may take action, such as litigation, asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existingproducts or that those patents are inval
id or unenforceable in order to achieve a “first-to-market” or early market position for our products.Third parties may cla
im that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by the third party. Claims of intellectual property infringement can becostly and time-consum
ing to resolve, may delay or prevent product launches, and may result in significant damages. We are involved in patent-related disputeswith third parties over ou
r attempts to market generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars. Once we have final regulatory approval of the related genericpharmaceuticals products 
or biosimilars, we may decide to commercially market these products even though associated legal proceedings (including anyappeals) have not been resolved (i.e., 
“at-risk” launch). If one of our marketed products is found to infr inge valid patent rights of a third party, such third partymay be awarded significant da
mages, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product. Such damages may be enhanced as much as three-fold in theevent that we or 
one of our subsidiaries, like Hospira, is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party. Any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effe
ct on our profitability and financial condition.RISK RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY
: INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY
Significant disrupt
ions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our businesses. We rely to a large extentupon sophisticated information te
chnology systems to operate our businesses. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amountsof confidential information 
(including, but not limited to, personal information and intellectual property), and we deploy and operate an array of technical andprocedural controls to mainta
in the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We also have outsourced significant elements of our operationsto third parties, includ
ing significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we are managing many independent vendorrelationships with th
ird parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology andinformation security s
ystems, and those of our third-party vendors with whom we contract (and the large amounts of confidential information that is present onthem), make such systems potentia
lly vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees orvendors, or from at
tacks by malicious third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with awide range of motives (includin
g, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation states andothers. As a global pharmaceuti
cal company, our systems are subject to frequent attacks. Due to the nature of some of these attacks, there is a risk that theymay remain undetected for a period of ti
me. While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, our efforts may not prevent serviceinterruptions or securit
y breaches. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss ofcritical or sensitive confidential inform
ation or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. We maintain cyberliability in
surance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruptionor breach of our systems.

TABLE OF CONTENTSRISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS
: STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS
The success of any of our strategic acqu
isitions will depend, in large part, on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from combining these businesses withPfizer. We, for example, m
ay fail to achieve cost savings anticipated with certain of these acquisitions, or such cost savings within the expected time frame.Similarly, the ac
cretive impact anticipated from certain of these acquisitions may not be realized or may be delayed. Integration of these businesses may resultin the loss of key employees, the d
isruption of ongoing business, including third-party relationships, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures andpolicies. We also 
may fail to generate the revenue growth for the acquired business that we expected at the time of entering into the transaction. Expectedrevenue from acquired products and product 
candidates also may be constrained by developments outside of our control. Unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatoryhurdles and commercial
ization challenges may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from products and product candidates, including thoseacquired in these acq
uisitions. Hospira, for example, has experienced manufacturing disruptions and substantial regulatory scrutiny due to quality issues.Manufacturing problems, as we
ll as any corrective actions and their operational implementation, could adversely impact the revenue we generate from productsacquired from Hospira and re
sult in substantial unanticipated costs. For additional information, see the Overview of Our Performance, Ope rating Environment,Strategy and Outlook
–– Our Business Development Initiatives section in our 2019  Financial Report. PENDING COMBINATION OF UPJOHN WITH MYLAN
Pfizer, Mylan and Upjohn may be unable to satisfy 
the conditions or obtain the approvals required to complete the combination of Upjohn with Mylan(the Combination), and regulatory agencies 
may delay or impose conditions on approval of the Combination, which may diminish the anticipatedbenefits of the Combination.
The consummation of the Combination 
is subject to numerous conditions, including the receipt by Pfizer of an Internal Revenue Service ruling and an opinion ofits tax counsel to the effect that, among other thing
s, certain transactions related to the Combination and certain related transactions will constitute a tax-free“reorganization” with
in the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code, the approval of the Combination by Mylan shareholders, and othercustomary conditions, certa
in of which are dependent upon the actions of third parties. As a result of such conditions, Pfizer cannot make any assurances thatthe Combination will be consumma
ted on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.Completion of the Combinat
ion is also conditioned upon the receipt of certain required government consents and approvals, including certain approvals requiredfrom regulatory agencies. Wh
ile Pfizer, Mylan and Upjohn intend to pursue vigorously all required governmental approvals, the requirement to receive theseapprovals prior to the consummat
ion of the Combination could delay the completion of the Combination, possibly for a significant period of time. Any delay in thecompletion of the Combination 
could diminish the anticipated benefits of the Combination or result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other effectsassociated with uncertainty
 about the Combination, including delaying Pfizer’s ability to capitalize on its strategy of becoming a more focused, innovativecompany as well as Upjohn’s ability to
 optimize the execution of its growth strategies.Pfizer may be subject to shareho
lder lawsuit, or other actions filed in connection with or in opposition to the Combination or any related transactions. Suchlitigation could have an adve
rse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of Pfizer and could prevent or delay the consummation of theCombination.
Pfizer has expended and wil
l continue to expend significant management time and resources and has incurred and will continue to incur significant expensesdue to legal, advisory, print
ing and financial services fees related to the Combination, including costs required to obtain the required government consents ordefend or settle actions noted above. We expect to 
incur costs of approximately $500 million in connection with fully separating Upjohn, inclusive of $145 million incurred in 2019. Such charges 
will include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and anticipated transaction costs. Many of these expensesmust be paid regardless of whether the 
Combination is consummated, and even if the expected benefits of the Combination are not achieved. Additionally, thecompletion of the Combin
ation, including for example, obtaining regulatory approvals, will require significant time and attention from Pfizer management andmay divert attention from the day-to-da
y operations of our business.Even if the Combination is completed as anticipated, 
Pfizer may not realize some or all of the expected benefits. Furthermore, Upjohn mayexperience operational challenges in integrating the Upjohn and Mylan businesses, which 
may also diminish the anticipated benefits of theCombination.
Even if the Combination i
s completed, the anticipated operational, financial, strategic and other benefits of the Combination may not be achieved. There aremany factors that could impact the ant
icipated benefits from the Combination, including, among others, strategic adjustments required to reflect the nature of ourbusiness following the 
Combination, any negative reaction to the Combination by our customers and business partners, and increased risks resulting from Pfizerbecoming a company that is more focu
sed on innovative medicines. In addition, Pfizer has agreed to provide certain transition services to the combinedcompany, generally for 
an initial period of 24 months following the completion of the Combination (with certain possibilities for extension). These obligationsunder the transition agreements may re
sult in additional expenses and may divertPfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTSPfizer’s focus and resources
 that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing Pfizer’s business. An inability to realize the full extent of theanticipated benefits of the Combinat
ion, as well as any delays encountered in the process, could have an adverse effect on the revenues, level of expenses andoperating results of 
our business.Furthermore, the Com
bination is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. Even if Upjohn and Mylan successfully integrate, Pfizer, Upjohn and Mylancannot predict with certaint
y if or when the anticipated synergies, growth opportunities and benefits resulting from the Combination will occur, or the extent towhich they actually 
will be achieved. For example, the benefits from the Combination may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the companies or by requiredcapital expenditures related to the 
combined businesses. In addition, the quantification of synergies expected to result from the Combination is based onsignificant estimates and a
ssumptions that are subjective in nature and inherently uncertain. Realization of any benefits and synergies could be affected by anumber of factors 
beyond Pfizer’s, Mylan’s, Upjohn’s or the combined company’s control, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, increasedoperating costs, regulatory deve
lopments and the other risks described in these risk factors. The amount of synergies actually realized in the Combination, ifany, and the time periods in wh
ich any such synergies are realized, could differ materially from the synergies anticipated to be realized, regardless of whetherthe two business operations are co
mbined successfully. If the integration is unsuccessful or if the combined company is unable to realize the anticipatedsynergies and other benefits of the Comb
ination, there could be a material adverse effect on the combined company’s share price, business, financial conditionand results of operations.
CONSUMER HEALTHCARE JOINT VENTURE WITH GSK
On July 31, 2019, we completed the transact
ion in which we and GSK combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new consumerhealthcare joint venture that operates g
lobally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. Following the integration of the combined business, GSK intends toseparate the joint venture as an independent compan
y via a demerger of its equity interest to its shareholders and a listing of the combined business on the U.K.equity market. In February 2020, GSK announced the 
initiation of a two-year program to prepare for the separation of GSK into two companies, including astandalone Consumer Healthca
re company. Until the fifth anniversary of the closing of the transaction, GSK will have the sole right to decide whether and whento initiate a separation and l
isting, and may also sell all or part of its stake in the joint venture in a contemporaneous initial public offering. Should a separationand listing occur during the f
irst five years after closing, Pfizer has the option to participate through the distribution of some or all of its equity interest in the jointventure to its share
holders. Following a separation or listing, and subject to customary lock-up or similar restrictions, Pfizer will also have the ability to sell itsequity interest in the joint 
venture through the capital markets. After the fifth anniversary of the closing of the transaction, both GSK and Pfizer will have the rightto decide whether and when to init
iate a separation and public listing of the joint venture. The planned separation and public listing transactions may not beinitiated or completed w
ithin the expected time periods or at all, and both the timing and success of any separation and public listing transaction, as well as thevalue generated for Pfizer or it
s shareholders in any such transaction, will be subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors at the time of suchtransaction. Although Pfizer 
is entitled to participate in any separation and listing transaction initiated by GSK prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing, it is notrequired to do so, and any future distribut
ion or sale of Pfizer’s equity stake in the joint venture will similarly be subject to prevailing market conditions and otherfactors at the time of such transaction. 
Pfizer’s ability to complete any such future distribution or sale may also be impacted by the size of Pfizer’s retained equitystake at the time. The uncertainty relat
ing to the separation and public listing transactions, their implementation, their timing and their yet to be determinedeffects on the joint venture’s bus
iness may subject us and the joint venture to risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business and financial results.Moreover, although we have certain 
consent, board representation and other governance rights with respect to the joint venture, Pfizer is a minority owner of thejoint venture. As a result, Pf
izer does not have control over the joint venture, its management or its policies and we may have business interests, strategies andgoals that differ in certain re
spects from those of GSK or the joint venture.In addition, the joint venture w
ill be subject to the risks associated with the joint venture’s consumer healthcare business, and the business, financial conditionand results of operations of the joint 
venture may be affected by factors that are different from or in addition to those that previously affected the business,financial condition and re
sults of operations of Pfizer’s historical consumer healthcare business. Many of these factors are outside of our and the joint venture’scontrol, and could material
ly impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the joint venture.The success of the transaction w
ill also depend, in part, on the joint venture’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost synergies from the transaction.These anticipated benefits and cost sav
ings may not be realized or may not be realized within the expected time period. The joint venture’s integration of Pfizer’sand GSK’s historic consumer h
ealthcare businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, costs, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, and lossof customer and other business relat
ionships. Any material unanticipated issues arising from the integration process could negatively impact our stock price andour or the joint venture’s future bus
iness and financial results. Pfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTSOTHER RISKS:
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
Like all businesses of our size
, we are exposed to both global and industry-specific economic conditions. Governments, corporations, and insu rance companies,which provide insuran
ce benefits to patients, have implemented increases in cost-sharing and restrictions on access to medicines, potentially causing patients toswitch to generic or bio
similar products, delay treatments, skip doses or use less effective treatments. As discussed above, government financing pressures canlead to negative pricing pres
sure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria (e.g., through public or private healthtechnology assessments), or other 
means of cost control.The global economic environ
ment has not had, nor do we anticipate that it will have, a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Due to our significantoperating cash flows, financ
ial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that wehave, and will mainta
in, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We monitor our liquidity position continuously in the face of evolvingeconomic conditions, but there can be no gua
rantee that changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions will not affect our liquidity or capitalresources or impact our abi
lity to obtain financing in the future.We continue to monitor
 credit, capital restrictions and economic situations in volatile regions and markets, especially where the ability to obtain U.S. dollars forlocal currency is unp
redictable and challenging. We cannot predict the likelihood of future changes in these economic conditions, or what impact they may haveon our results of operations, financ
ial condition or business.In addition, given that a signif
icant portion of our business is conducted in the EU, including the U.K., the formal change in the relationship between the U.K. andthe EU caused by Brexit m
ay pose certain implications for our research, commercial and general business operations in the U.K. and the EU, including theapproval and supply o
f our products. Details on how Brexit will be finally executed and the impact on the remaining EU countries will dictate how and whetherthe broader EU will be 
impacted and what the resulting impact on our business may be. For additional information, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Out
look–– The Global Economic Environment section in our 2019  Financial Report. Public health epidemics or ou
tbreaks could adversely impact our business. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan,Hubei Province, China
.  While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused significant disruptions to its economy, it has now spread toseveral other countries and infe
ctions have been reported globally. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations will depend on futuredevelopments, which are high
ly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information which may emergeconcerning the severity of the corona
virus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. In particular, the continued spread of thecoronavirus globally could advers
ely impact our operations, including among others, our manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing and clinical trialoperations and could have an adverse i
mpact on our business and our financial results.We also continue to monitor the g
lobal trade environment and potential trade conflicts and impediments. If trade restrictions or tariffs reduce global economicactivity, or if other fac
tors lead to a general economic downturn, potential impacts could include declining sales; increased costs; volatility in foreign exchangerates; a decline in the value of our f
inancial assets and pension plan investments; required increases of our pension funding obligations; increased governmentcost control efforts; delays or fa
ilures in the performance of customers, suppliers, and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of ourbusiness; and the risk that our al
lowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate.FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK
Significant portions of our 
revenues, costs and expenses, as well as our substantial international net assets, are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates.54%
 of our total 2019  revenues were derived from international operations, including 21%  from Europe and 24%  from China, Japan and the rest of Asia. As weoperate in multiple foreign 
currencies, including the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen, the Canadian dollar, the U.K. pound and approximately 100other currencies, chan
ges in those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. If the U.S. dollar were to weaken againstanother currency, assuming al
l other variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenseswould increase, having a negat
ive impact on earnings. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar were to strengthen against another currency, assuming all other variablesremained constant, our revenues wou
ld decrease, having a negative impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact onearnings. Therefore, signifi
cant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.The impact of possible c
urrency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations, including Venezuela andArgentina, can impact our resu
lts and financial guidance. For additional information about ou r exposure to foreign currency risk, see the Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures Abou

ity announced in July 2017 that it will no longer compel banks to submit rates that are currently used to calculate LIBOR after 2021.Various governing parties, 
including government agencies, are working on a benchmark transition plan for LIBOR (and other interbank offered rates globally). We are monitoring their pr
ogress, and we will likely amend contracts to accommodate any replacement rate where it is not already provided. As a result, ourinterest expense could increa

In 2018, we adopted a new accounting standard whereb
y certain equity investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value now recognized in netincome. We expect the adoption of this ne

IC INITIATIVES ANDACQUISITIONS
Growth in costs and expenses, changes 
in product, segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, internalreorganizations, product w
ithdrawals, recalls and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies, evaluation of asset realization andorganizational restructur

d productivity initiatives; (ii) the reorganization of our commercial operations in 2019; (iii) any other corporate strategic initiatives; and (iv)any acquisitions, divestitures 
or other initiatives, such as our agreement to combine Upjohn with Mylan, creating a new global pharmaceutical company, which isanticipated to close in m
id-2020, our acquisition of Array and the formation of the new consumer healthcare joint venture with GSK.INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL AND EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS
Our consolidated balanc
e sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill. For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure is significant, andthere can be no certainty that these assets ult
imately will yield successful products. The nature of the biopharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires thatwe invest in a large number of p
rojects in an effort to achieve a successful portfolio of approved products. Our ability to realize value on these significantinvestments is often contingent upon, among othe
r things, regulatory approvals and market acceptance. As such, we expect that many of these IPR&D assetswill become impa
ired and be written off at some time in the future. If the associated R&D effort is abandoned, the related IPR&D assets will likely be written-off,and we will record an impairment c
harge. For goodwill, all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a goodwill impairment charge(such as, among other things, unantic
ipated competition, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a significant adverse change in legal matters or in thebusiness climate and/or a fa
ilure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity). Any such charge may be significant. Our other intangiblePfizer Inc.

We also regularly re
view our equity-method investments for impairment. An impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events ormanagement decisions that impact ou
r estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from these investments. We may recognize impairment charges as aresult of a weak economic env
ironment, events related to particular customers or asset types, challenging market conditions or decisions by management.TERRORIST ACTIVITY

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Information required by this 
item is incorporated by reference from the discussion under the heading Financial Review  in our 2019  Financial Report. ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Risk Management
The objective of our financia
l risk management program is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on ourearnings. We manage these financia
l exposures through operational means and through the use of third-party instruments. These practices may change aseconomic conditions change.
Foreign Exchange Risk
We operate globally and
, as such, we are subject to foreign exchange risk in our commercial operations, as well as in our financial assets (investments) andliabilities (borrowings). Our net investm
ents in foreign subsidiaries are also subject to currency risk.On the commercial side, a s
ignificant portion of our revenues and earnings is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. See the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environ
ment, Strategy and Outlook— The Global Economic Environment section in our 2019  Financial Report for th e key currencies inwhich we operate. We seek to manage ou
r foreign exchange risk, in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation tosame-currency costs and s
ame-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. Where foreign exchange risk cannot be mitigated via operational means,we may use foreign currency fo
rward-exchange contracts and/or foreign currency swaps to manage that risk.With respect to our fin
ancial assets and liabilities, our primary foreign exchange exposure arises predominantly from short-term and long-term intercompanyreceivables and payables, and, to a 
lesser extent, from short-term and long-term investments and debt, where the assets and/or liabilities are denominated incurrencies other than the functional 
currency of the business entity.We also hedge some forecasted inter
company sales denominated in euro, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, U.K. pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollarto protect against
 longer-term movements.In addition, under certain market cond
itions, we may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign business entities. Inthese cases, we may use foreign cu
rrency swaps, foreign currency forward-exchange contracts and/or foreign currency debt.For details about these and other financia
l instruments, including fair valuation methodologies, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7A. Financial Instruments
: Fair Value Measurements in our 2019  Financial Report. The fair values of our financia
l instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. In this sensitivityanalysis, holding al
l other assumptions constant and assuming that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the U.S. dollar would not have any effect onanother currency’s rates re
lative to the U.S. dollar, if the dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10%, as of December 31, 2019 , the expected adverse impact on our net income 
would not be significant.Interest Rate Risk
We are subject to interest rate r
isk on our investments and on our borrowings. We manage interest rate risk in the aggregate, while focusing on Pfizer’simmediate and intermediat
e liquidity needs.With respect to our investment
s, we strive to maintain a predominantly floating-rate basis position, but our strategy may change based on prevailing marketconditions. Our floating-rate a
ssets are subject to the risk that short-term interest rates may fall and, as a result, the investments would generate less interestincome. Fixed-rate invest
ments provide a known amount of interest income regardless of a change in interest rates. We sometimes use interest rate swaps inour financial investment p
ortfolio.Pfizer Inc.
2019 Form 10-K 41 
TABLE OF CONTENTSWe borrow primari
ly on a long-term, fixed-rate basis. From time to time, depending on market conditions, we will change the profile of our outstanding debt byentering into derivative 
financial instruments like interest rate swaps.For details about these and other financia
l instruments, including fair valuation methodologies, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7A. Financial Instruments
: Fair Value Measurements in our 2019  Financial Report. The fair values of our financia
l instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. In this sensitivity analysis,holding all other assumpt
ions constant and assuming a parallel shift in the interest rate curve for all maturities and for all instruments, if there were a onehundred basis point increase 
in interest rates as of December 31, 2019 , the expected adverse impact on our net inco me would not be significant.Equity Price Risk
We hold equity securities with re
adily determinable fair values in life science companies as a result of certain business development transactions. While we areholding such securitie
s, we are subject to equity price risk, and this may increase the volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the fair value ofequity investments. From
 time to time, we will sell such equity securities based on our business considerations, which may include limiting our price risk.Our equity securities with rea
dily determinable fair values are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to equity price rate changes. In this sensitivityanalysis, the expected adverse 
impact on our net income would not be significant.ITEM 8.

As of February 27, 2020, Pfizer Inc. has common stock, the 0.000% Notes due 2020 (the 2020 notes), the 0.250% Notes du
e 2022 (the 2022 notes)and the 1.000% Notes due 2027 (the 2027 n
otes and together with the 2020 notes and the 2022 notes, the notes) registered under Section 12 of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The fol
lowing descriptions of our common stock and the notes are summaries and do not purport tobe complete. The description of our common stock is subject to and qualifi
ed in its entirety by reference to our restated certificate of incorporation, asamended (the Certificate of Incorporation), and our bylaws, as amended (the Byl
aws), and the description of the notes is subject to and qualified inits entirety by reference to the base indenture (as defined below) an
d the ninth supplemental indenture (as defined below), each of which areincorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annua
l Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.21 is a part. We encourage you to read ourCertificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws, the applicable prov
isions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL), the base indenture and theninth supplemental indenture for add
itional information. References in this section to “Pfizer,” “we,” “us” and “our” are to Pfizer Inc., unless otherwisestated or the context so requires.
DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK
Common Stock
Under the Certificate of Incorporation, we are authorized to issue up to 12 bi
llion shares of common stock, par value $0.05 per share. The commonstock is not redeemable, does not have any conversion rig
hts and is not subject to call. Holders of shares of common stock have no preemptiverights to maintain their percentage of ownership in future offerings or sales of our stock. Hold
ers of shares of common stock have one vote per sharein all elections of Directors and on all other matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The hol
ders of common stock are entitled to receivedividends, if any, as and when may be declare
d from time to time by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available therefor. Upon liquidation,dissolution or winding up of our affairs, the hold
ers of common stock will be entitled to participate equally and ratably, in proportion to the number ofshares held, in our net assets available for distributio
n to holders of common stock. The shares of common stock currently outstanding are fully paidand nonassessable. The common stock is traded on the Ne
w York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol “PFE.”Preferred Stock
Under the Certificate of Incorporation, we are authorized to issue up to 27 mill
ion shares of preferred stock, without par value, of which 7,500 sharesof preferred stock have been designated Series A conv
ertible perpetual preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series,and the Board of Directors of Pfizer is expressly authorized (i) to fix the descriptions, powers, preferences, rights, qualific
ations, limitations, andrestrictions with respect to any series of preferred stock and (ii) to specify the number of shares of any series of preferred stock.
Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock
. Our Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock is held by an Employe e Stock Ownership Plan(Preferred ESOP) Trust and provides dividends in an amount not

to exceed 6.25% of the stated value, which are paid quarterly. The stated value is $40,300 per share, and the Series A convertible perpetualpreferred stock ranks senior to our common stock and junior to all other preferred stock as to dividends and li
quidation rights, unless designated asranking senior or on a parity with the new preferred stock. Each share is convertibl
e, at the holder’s option, at a conversion rate initially equivalent to2,574.8685 shares of our common stock for each preferred share converted, subject to adjustment. Each share of Series A co
nvertible perpetualpreferred stock is entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which such convertible p
erpetual preferred stockcould be converted on the record date for determining the stockhol
ders entitled to vote in any matter submitted to the stockholders to vote. Theholders of Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock are entitl
ed to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, voting togetherwith the holders of common stock as one class. The conversion option is i
ndexed to our common stock and requires share settlement, and,therefore, is reported at the fair value at the date of issuance. We may redeem the Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock at any time or
upon termination of the Preferred ESOP, at our option, in cash, in shares of common stock, or a combination of both at a price of $40,300 p
er share,plus any accrued and unpaid d
ividends to the redemption date. We will also redeem the Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock in cash, or atour election, in shares of common stock, or a combination of any shares of common stock to be valued at their fair market value, at a price of
$40,300 per share, upon certification of the holder to us of certain events. Hol
ders of Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock have nopreemptive rights to maintain their percentage of ownership i
n future offerings or sales of our stock.Anti-takeover Effects of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws and Delaware Law
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
. Various provisions contained in the Certificate of Incorporati on and the Bylaws could delay or discouragesome transactions involving an actual or potenti
al change in control of us or a change in our management and may limit the ability of ourstockholders to remove current management or approve transactions that our stockholders may deem to be in their best interests. Among oth
erthings, these provisions:
•
limit the right of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders to holders of at least 10% of the total number of shares of stockentitled to vote on the matter to be brought before the proposed special meetin
g;•
authorize our Board of Directors to establish one or more series of preferred stock without stockholder approval;•
authorize the Board to issue dividends in the form of stock purchase or similar rights, including rights that would have the effect ofmaking an attempt to acquire us more costly;
•
grant to the Board of Directors, and not to the stockholders, the sole power to set the number of Directors;•
require that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meetingof stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing; and
•
subject to the rights of the holders of any one or more series of preferred stock then outstanding, allow our Directors, and not ourstockholders, to fill vacancies on our Board of

Directors, including vacancies resulting from the removal of one or more Directors or an increase in the number of Directors constitutingthe whole Board of Directors.
Delaware Law
. We are a Delaware corporation and conseque ntly are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the DGCL. Subject to certainexceptions, Section 203 of the DGCL prevents a publ
icly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with any “interestedstockholder” for three years following the date that the person became an intereste
d stockholder, unless (a) the interested stockholder attained suchstatus with the approval of the corporation’s board of directors, (b) upon consummation of the transaction that resulte
d in the stockholder becomingan interested stockholder, the interested stockholder own
ed at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time thetransaction commenced, exclusive of shares owned by directors wh
o are also officers and by certain employee stock plans or (c) at or subsequent tosuch time, the business combination is approved by the b
oard of directors and authorized by the affirmative vote at a stockholders’ meeting, and notby written consent, of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owne
d by the interested stockholder. A “business combination”includes, among other things, a merger or consolidatio
n involving the corporation and the “interested stockholder” and the sale of more than 10% ofthe corporation’s assets. In general, an “interested stockholder” is any entity or person be
neficially owning 15% or more of the corporation’soutstanding voting stock, and any entity or person affiliated w
ith or controlling or controlled by such entity or person. Section 203 makes it moredifficult for an interested stockholder to effect various business combinatio
ns with a corporation for a three-year period. This statute could prohibit ordelay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts not approved in adva
nce by our Board of Directors, and, as a result, could discourageattempts to acquire us, which could depress the market price of our common stock.
DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES
Reference should be made to the indenture d
ated as of January 30, 2001, between Pfizer and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known asThe Bank of New York), as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chas
e Manhattan Bank), as trustee, which we refer to asthe “base indenture,” as supplemented by the ninth sup
plemental indenture dated as of March 6, 2017, among Pfizer Inc., The Bank of New YorkMellon, as trustee, and The Bank of New York Mellon, Londo
n Branch, as paying agent, which we refer to as the “ninth supplemental indenture.”When we refer to the “indenture,” we mean the base indenture, as supplemente
d by the ninth supplemental indenture. The following description is asummary of selected portions of the base indenture and the ninth sup
plemental indenture. It does not restate the base indenture or the ninthsupplemental indenture, and those d
ocuments, not this description, define the rights of a holder of the notes.Principal, Maturity and Interest
The 2020 notes were limited to €1,000,000,0
00 aggregate principal amount, the 2022 notes were limited to €1,000,000,000 aggregate principalamount and the 2027 notes were limited to €750,0
00,000 aggregate principal amount. The 2020 Notes will mature on March 6, 2020, the 2022 noteswill mature on March 6, 2022 and the 2027 notes wil
l mature on March 6, 2027. We issued the notes in denominations of €100,000 and in integralmultiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.
Interest on the 2020 notes accrues at the annual rate of 0.000%, interest on the 2022 notes accru
es at the annual rate of 0.250% and interest on the2027 notes accrues at the annual rate of 1.000%. Interest on the notes is payabl
e on March 6 of each year. Interest on the notes is computed on thebasis of the

actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on whichinterest was paid on the notes to, but excluding, the next schedu
led interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to asACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) (as defined in the rulebo
ok of the International Capital Market Association).We make each interest payment to the holders of record of the notes at the close of business on the 15th calen
dar day (whether or not a businessday) preceding the relevant interest payment date.
The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branc
h, acts as our paying agent with respect to the notes. Upon notice to the trustee, we may change anypaying agent. Payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, will b
e made by us through the paying agent to Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (the“Euroclear Operator”), as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and/or Clearstream Banking, Société Anonyme, Luxemb
ourg(“Clearstream”) as described under “—Book-Entry.”
Issuance in Euros
Principal, premium, if any, and interest payments and addition
al amounts, if any, in respect of the notes are payable in euros.If the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of excha
nge controls or other circumstances beyond our control or the euro is no longer used bythe then member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the e
uro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by publicinstitutions within the international b
anking community, then all payments in respect of the notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is againavailable to us or so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable o
n any date in euros will be converted to U.S. dollars on the basis of the mostrecently available market exchange rate for euros, as determined by us in o
ur sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the notes so made in U.S.dollars does not constitute an event of default under the in
denture or the notes. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent is responsible for obtainingexchange rates, effecting conversions or otherwise han
dling redenominations.Payment of Additional Amounts
All payments in respect of the notes are made by or on behalf of us without withho
lding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or futuretaxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, imposed or levie
d by the United States or any taxing authority thereof ortherein, unless such withholdin
g or deduction is required by law. If such withholding or deduction is required by law, we pay to a beneficial ownerwho is not a United States person such additio
nal amounts on the notes as are necessary in order that the net payment of the principal of, andpremium or redemption price, if any, and interest on, such notes to such beneficial ow
ner, after such withholding or deduction (including anywithholding or deduction o
n such additional amounts), will not be less than the amount provided in such notes to be then due and payable; provided,however, that the foregoing obligation to pay a
dditional amounts will not apply:(a)

Ranking
The notes are unsecured general obl
igations of Pfizer and rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Pfizer fromtime to time outstanding.
Listing
The notes are listed on the NYSE. We have no obli
gation to maintain such listing, and we may delist the notes at any time.Covenants
The indenture contains a provision that restricts our ability to conso
lidate with or merge into any other person or convey or transfer our propertiesand assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to any other person. The ind
enture does not restrict our ability to convey or transfer ourproperties and assets other than as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to any other perso
n. See “Article VIII - Consolidation, Merger,Conveyance or Transfer” in the base indenture. The ind
enture contains no other restrictive covenants, including those that would afford holders ofthe notes protection in the event of a highly-leverage
d transaction involving Pfizer or any of its affiliates or other events involving us that mayadversely affect our creditworthiness or the value of the notes. The indenture als
o does not contain any
covenants relating to total indebtedness, interest coverage, stock repurchases, recapitalizations, dividends and distributions to shareholders, currentratios or acquisitions and divestitures. The notes do not hav
e the benefit of covenants that relate to subsidiary guarantees, liens and sale leasebacktransactions that apply to other of our existing unsecured and uns
ubordinated notes.Pfizer may, without the consent of the holders of notes of any series, issue additiona
l notes having the same ranking and the same interest rate,maturity and other terms as the notes of any series (except for the issue date and the public offering price). Any addition
al notes having such similarterms, together with the notes of the applicable series, will constitute a sing
le series of debt securities under the indenture. No additional notes ofany series may be issued if an event of default has occurred with respect to the notes of that series. Pfizer will not issu
e any additional notesintended to form a single series with the notes of any series, unless such further notes wi
ll be fungible with all notes of the same series for U.S.federal income tax purposes.
Optional Redemption of 2022 Notes and 2027 Notes; Redemption for Tax Reasons; No Sinking Fund
At our option, we may redeem the 2022 notes or the 2027 notes (together, the redemption notes), in wh
ole, at any time, or in part, from time to time,prior to February 6, 2022 (one month prior to the maturity date) with respect to the 2022 notes and December 6, 2026 (three months prior to the
maturity date) with respect to the 2027 notes. The redemption price will be equ
al to the greater of the following amounts:•
100% of the principal amount of the redemption notes being redeemed on the redemption date; and•
the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the redemption notes being redeemedon that redemption date (not including the amount, if any, of accrued and u
npaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date)discounted to the redemption date on an ann
ual basis at a rate equal to the sum of the Comparable Government Bond Rate plus (a) 15basis points in the case of the 2022 notes and (b) 15 basis p
oints in the case of the 2027 notes;plus, in each case, accrued and unpai
d interest on the redemption notes being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.At any time on or after February 6, 2022 (one month prior to the maturity date) with respect to the 2022 notes and December 6, 2026 (three months
prior to the maturity date) with respect to the 2027 notes, we may redeem such series of redemption notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the redemption n
otes to be redeemed, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the redemptionnotes being redeemed to, but excluding, the redempti
on date.Notwithstanding the foregoing, instal
lments of interest on the applicable redemption notes that are due and payable on interest payment dates fallingon or prior to a redemption date will be payable o
n the interest payment date to the registered holders as of the close of business on the relevantrecord date according to the applicable red
emption notes and the indenture. The redemption prices for the redemption notes will be calculated onthe basis of a 365-day year or a 366-day year, as applicabl
e, and the actual number of days elapsed.
We will mail notice of any redemption at least 10 days, but not more than 60 days, before the redemption date to each registered holder of theredemption notes to be redeemed. Once notice of redemption is maile
d, the redemption notes called for redemption will become due and payable onthe redemption date at the applicable redempti
on price, plus accrued and unpaid interest applicable to such redemption notes to, but excluding, theredemption date.
“Comparable Government Bond” means, in relation to any Compara
ble Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an IndependentInvestment Banker, a German government bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of the redemption notes to be redeemed, or if such
independent investment bank in its discreti
on determines that such similar bond is not in issue, such other German government bond as suchIndependent Investment Banker may, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market makers in, German government bonds selected by us,
determine to be appropriate for determining the Comparabl
e Government Bond Rate.“Comparable Government Bond Rate” means the price, expressed as a perce
ntage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being roundedupwards), at which the gross redemption yield on the fixed rate notes to be rede
emed, if they were to be purchased at such price on the thirdbusiness day prior to the date fixed for redemption, would be eq
ual to the gross redemption yield on such business day of the ComparableGovernment Bond on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable Government Bo
nd prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on suchbusiness day as determined by an Indepe
ndent Investment Banker.“Independent Investment Banker” means one of the Reference Treasury Dea
lers appointed by us to act as the “Independent Investment Banker.”“Reference Treasury Dealer” means each of Barclays Bank PLC, BN
P Paribas, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc (or theirrespective affiliates that are Primary Treasury Dealers), and their respective successors; provided, how
ever, that if any of the foregoing shall ceaseto be a broker or dealer of, and/or market maker in, German government bonds (a “Primary Treasury Dealer”), we will substitute therefor another
Primary Treasury Dealer.
On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the redemption notes or any p
ortion of the redemption notes called for redemption(unless we default in the payment of the redemption price and accru
ed and unpaid interest). On or before the redemption date, we will deposit with apaying agent (or the trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued an
d unpaid interest on the redemption notes to beredeemed on that date. If fewer than all of the redemption notes of any series are to be redeemed, the redemption n
otes to be redeemed shall beselected by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, in the case of redemption notes repres
ented by a global security, or by the trustee by a method thetrustee deems to be fair and appropriate, in the case of redemption notes that are not represented by a gl
obal security.The notes are not entitled to the benefit of a sinking fund.
Redemption for Tax Reasons
If, as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated un
der the laws) of the United States (or anytaxing authority thereof or therein), or any change in, or amendments to, an official position reg
arding the application or interpretation of such laws,regulations or

rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after February 28, 2017, we become or, based upon a written opinionof independent tax counsel of recogniz
ed standing selected by us, will become obligated to pay additional amounts as described herein under theheading “—Payment of Additional Amo
unts” with respect to any series of the notes, then we may at our option, having given not less than 10 normore than 60 days prior notice to holders, redeem, in whole, but not in part, the applic
able series of notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of theprincipal amount, together with accrued and un
paid interest (including any additional amounts) on such notes to, but excluding, the redemption date.Book-Entry
Global Clearance and Settlement
The notes of each series were issued in the form of one or more global notes in ful
ly registered form, without coupons, and are deposited with, or onbehalf of, a common depositary, and registered in the name of the nominee of the common de
positary, for, and in respect of interests held through,Euroclear and Clearstream. Except as described herei
n, certificates will not be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the global notesrepresenting the notes.
Except as set forth below, the global notes representing the notes may be transferred, in wh
ole and not in part, only to Euroclear or Clearstream ortheir respective nominees.
Beneficial interests in the global n
otes representing the notes are represented, and transfers of such beneficial interests are effected, throughaccounts of financial institutions acting on b
ehalf of beneficial owners as direct or indirect participants in Euroclear or Clearstream. Those beneficialinterests are in denominations of €100,000 a
nd integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Investors may hold the notes directly throughEuroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizatio
ns that are participants in such systems.For so long as any series of the notes is represented by a global n
ote deposited with, and registered in the name of a nominee for, a commondepositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, each person (other than Eurocle
ar or Clearstream) who is for the time being shown in the records ofEuroclear or of Clearstream as the holder of a particular nominal amount of the notes (in wh
ich regard any certificate or other document issued byEuroclear or Clearstream as to the nominal amount of the notes standing to the accou
nt of any person shall be conclusive and binding for allpurposes save in the case of manifest error) shall upon their receipt of a certificate or other document be treated by Pfizer and the trustee as the
holder of such nominal amount of the notes and the registered h
older of the global note representing such notes shall be deemed not to be theholder for all purposes other than with respect to the payment of principal or interest on suc
h nominal amount of the notes, for which purpose theregistered holder of the relevant global note sh
all be treated by Pfizer and the trustee as the holder of such nominal amount of notes in accordancewith and subject to the terms of the global note representing the notes, and the ex
pressions “noteholder” and “holder of notes” and relatedexpressions shall be 
construed accordingly.The information in this section concerning Euroc
lear and Clearstream Banking and their book-entry systems and procedures has been obtained fromsources that we believe to be reliable. We are not responsi
ble for the accuracy or completeness of this information.We have been advised by Clearstream and Euroc
lear, respectively, as follows:
Clearstream has advised that:•
It is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and licensed as a bank and professional depositary. Clearstream holds securities for itsparticipating organizations an
d facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants throughelectronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participa
nts, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates.•
Clearstream provides to its participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement ofinternationally traded securities and sec
urities lending and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in severalcountries.
•
Clearstream has established an electronic bridge with the Euroclear Operator to facilitate the settlement of trades between thenominees of Clearstream and Euroclear.
•
As a registered bank in Luxembourg, Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Commission for the Supervision of theFinancial Sector.
•
Clearstream customers are recognized financial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other orga
nizations and may include the underwriters. Indirect access toClearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, deal
ers and trust companies that clear through, or maintain a custodialrelationship with, a Clearstream participant, either directly or ind
irectly.Distributions with respect to the notes held benefici
ally through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream participants inaccordance with its rules and procedures.
Euroclear has advised that:
•
It was created in 1968 to hold securities for its participants and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear participants throughsimultaneous electronic book-entry deliv
ery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates andany risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash.
•
Euroclear includes various other services, including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in severalcountries.
•
Euroclear is operated by the Euroclear Operator. All operations are conducted by the Euroclear Operator, and all Euroclear securitiesclearance accounts and Euroclear cash acc
ounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator.•
Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the Terms and Conditions GoverningUse of Euroclear and the related operating proce
dures of Euroclear, and applicable Belgian law (collectively, the “Terms andConditions”). The Terms and Conditions govern transfers of securities an
d cash within Euroclear, withdrawals of securities and cashfrom Euroclear, and receipts of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in E
uroclear are held on a fungible basiswithout attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance acc
ounts. The
Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear participants, and has no records of or relationshipwith persons holding through Euroc
lear participants.•
Euroclear participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and other professional financialintermediaries and may include the und
erwriters. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through ormaintain a custodial relationshi
p with a Euroclear participant, either directly or indirectly.Distributions with respect to the notes held benefici
ally through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear participants inaccordance with the Terms and Conditions.
Euroclear and Clearstream Arrangements
So long as Euroclear or Clearstream or their nominee or their common depos
itary is the registered holder of the global notes representing the notes,Euroclear, Clearstream or such nominee, as the case may be, will be consi
dered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such globalnotes for all purposes under the indenture and the n
otes. Payments of principal, interest and additional amounts, if any, in respect of the global notesrepresenting the notes are made to Euroclear, Clearstream, such nominee or such common d
epositary, as the case may be, as registered holderthereof. Neither Pfizer nor the trustee, or any affiliate of any of the above or any person by whom any of the above is controlle
d (as such term isdefined in the Securities Act) has any responsib
ility or liability for any records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownershipinterests in the global notes representing the notes or for maintain
ing, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownershipinterests.
Distributions of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the global n
otes representing the notes are credited in euros to the extentreceived by Euroclear or Clearstream from the paying agent to the cash accounts of Eurocl
ear or Clearstream customers in accordance with therelevant system’s rules and procedures.
Because Euroclear and Clearstream can on
ly act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the ability of a personhaving an interest in the global notes repres
enting the notes to pledge such interest to persons or entities which do not participate in the relevantclearing system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate in respect of such interest.
Secondary Market Trading
Because the purchaser determines the place of del
ivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any notes where both the purchaser’sand seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be mad
e on the desired value date.We understand that secondary market trading between Clearstream and/or Euroc
lear participants occurs in the ordinary way following the applicablerules and operating procedures of Clearstream and E
uroclear. Secondary market trading is settled using procedures applicable to conventionaleurobonds in global regis
tered form.
The holder of the notes should be aware that investors are only able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications involvingthe notes through Clearstream and Euroclear on days wh
en those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business ondays when banks, brokers and other institutions are ope
n for business in the United States.In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be problems with compl
eting transactions involving Clearstream and Euroclear on the samebusiness day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the notes, or to make or receive a payment or deliv
ery ofthe notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions are not performed until the next business day in L
uxembourg or Brussels, depending onwhether Clearstream or Euroclear is used.
Clearstream or Euroclear credits payments to the cash accounts of Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants, as appl
icable, in accordancewith the relevant system’s rules and procedures, to the extent received by its depositary. Cle
arstream or the Euroclear Operator, as the case maybe, takes any other action permitted to be taken by a holder under the inde
nture on behalf of a Clearstream customer or Euroclear participant only inaccordance with its relevant rules and procedures.
Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoi
ng procedures in order to facilitate transfers of the notes among participants of Clearstreamand Euroclear. However, they are under no obli
gation to perform or continue to perform those procedures, and they may discontinue thoseprocedures at any time.
Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes
Subject to certain conditions, the notes represented by the gl
obal notes are exchangeable for certificated notes in definitive form of like tenor inminimum denominations of €100,000 princ
ipal amount and multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof if:•
the common depositary notifies us that it is no longer willing or able to act as a depositary for such global notes or ceases to be aclearing agency registered under the Exch
ange Act and we fail to appoint a successor common depositary within 90 days;•
an event of default has occurred and is continuing and the common depositary requests the issuance of certificated notes; or•
we determine not to have the notes represented by a global note.In all cases, certificated notes delivered in exchan
ge for any global note or beneficial interest therein will be registered in the names, and issued inany approved denominations, requ
ested by or on behalf of the common depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures).Payments (including principal, premium an
d interest) and transfers with respect to the notes in certificated form may be executed at the office oragency maintained for such purpose in Lo
ndon (initially the corporate trust office of the paying agent) or, at our option, by check mailed to theholders thereof at the respective addresses set forth in the register of holders of the notes (maintained by the registrar), provided that al
l payments(including principal, premium and i
nterest) on the notes in certificated form, for which the holders thereof have given wire transfer instructions, arerequired to be made by wire transfer of immediately available fun
ds to the accounts specified by the holders thereof. No service charge is
made for any registration of transfer, but payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge payable in connection with suchregistration may be required.
Modification of Indenture
Under the indenture, the rights of the holders of the notes may be modified through a su
pplemental indenture if the holders of a majority in aggregateprincipal amount of the outstanding notes of all seri
es affected by the modification (voting as one class) consent to it. No modification of the maturitydate or principal or interest payment terms, no modification of the currency for payment, no impairment of the right to sue for the enforcement of
payment at the maturity of the debt security, no modification of any conversion rights, no modification reduci
ng the percentage required for any suchsupplemental indenture or the percentag
e required for the waiver of certain defaults, and no modification of the foregoing provisions or any otherprovisions relating to the waiver of past defaults or the waiver of certain coven
ants, is effective against any holder without its consent.Events of Default
Each of the following will constitute an Ev
ent of Default under the indenture with respect to the notes of the applicable series:•
we fail to make the principal or any premium payment on any note of such series when due;•
we fail to make any sinking fund payment for 60 days after payment was due by the terms of any note of such series;•
we fail to pay interest on any note of such series for 60 days after payment was due;•
we fail to perform any other covenant in the indenture and this failure continues for 90 days after we receive written notice of it; or•
we, or a court, take certain actions relating to the bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of our company.A default under our other indebtedness wi
ll not be a default under the indenture for the notes, and a default under one series of the notes will notnecessarily be a default under another series. The trustee may withh
old notice to the holders of notes of the applicable series of any default (exceptfor defaults that involve our failure to pay principal or interest) if it considers such withh
olding of notice to be in the best interests of the holders.If an Event of Default with respect to outstanding notes of any series occurs and is continu
ing, then the trustee or the holders of at least 33% inprincipal amount of outstanding notes of that series may declare, in a written n
otice, the principal amount (or, if any of the notes of that series areoriginal issue discount securities, such p
ortion of the principal amount of such notes) plus accrued and unpaid interest on all notes of that series tobe immediately due and payabl
e. At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to notes of any series has been made, the holders of amajority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of such seri
es may rescind and annul the acceleration if:•
the holders act before the trustee has obtained a judgment or decree for payment of the money due;
•we have paid or deposited with the trustee a sum sufficient to pay overdue interest and overdue principal other than the acceleratedinterest and principal; and
•
we have cured or the holders have waived all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of accelerated principal and interest withrespect to notes of that series, as provided in the indenture.
If a default in the performance or breach of the indenture shall have occurred an
d be continuing, the holders of not less than a majority in principalamount of the outstanding notes of all series affected thereby, by notice to the trustee, may waive any past Event of Defau
lt or its consequencesunder the indenture. However, an Event of Default cann
ot be waived with respect to any series of notes in the following two circumstances:•
a failure to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, or interest on any security or in the payment of any sinking fund installment; or•
a covenant or provision that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each holder of outstanding notes of that series.Other than its duties in case of a default, the trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the ind
enture at the request, orderor direction of any holders, unless the holders offer the trustee reasonabl
e indemnity. Holders of a majority in principal amount outstanding of anyseries of notes may, subject to certain limitations, direct the time, method and place of conducting any proc
eeding or any remedy available to thetrustee, or exercising any power conferred upon the trustee, for such applicabl
e series of notes.We are required to deliver an annual officers’ certificate to the trustee, stating whether we are in d
efault in the performance and observance of any ofthe terms, provisions and conditions of the indenture, and, if we are in defa
ult, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof.Defeasance
When we use the term defeasance, we mean discharge from some or all of our obligati
ons under the indenture. Subject to certain additionalconditions, if we irrevocably deposit with the trustee sufficient cash or gov
ernment securities to pay the principal, interest, any premium and anyother sums due to the stated maturity date or a redemption date of the notes of a particular series, then at our option:
•
we will be discharged from our obligations with respect to the notes of such series; or•
we will no longer be under any obligation to comply with certain restrictive covenants under the indenture, and certain events of default willno longer apply to us.
 
To exercise our defeasance option, we must deliver to the trustee an officer’s certificate and a
n opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditionsprecedent related to the defeasance have be
en complied with.

OVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK
Financial Highlights
The following charts provide a summary of certain financial performance (in billions, except per share data):
2019 Total Revenues––$51.8 billion
2019 Net Cash Flow from Operations––$12.6 billion A decrease of 4% compared to 2018
A decrease of 20% compared to 2018 
 
2019 Reported Diluted EPS––$2.87
2019 Adjusted Diluted EPS (Non- GAAP )––$2.95* An increase of 54% compared to 2018
An increase of 1% compared to 2018 
 
*
For additional information regarding Adjusted diluted EPS (which is a non-GAAP financial measure), including reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAAP adjusted information, see the “Non-GAAPFinancial Measure (Adjusted Incom
e)” section of this Financial Review. We have revised 2018 and 2017 Adjusted diluted EPS to conform with our 2019 presentation (see the “Non-GAAP Financial Measure(Adjusted Income)––Certain Sig
nificant Items)” section of this Financial Review).Our Business
We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives through the discovery, development, manufacture and
distribution of healthcare products, including innovative medicines and vaccines. We work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention,
treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. We collaborate with healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and
expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. Our revenues are derived from the sale of our products and, to a
 much lesser extent, from allianceagreements, under which we co-promote products discovered or developed by other companies or us
 (Alliance revenues). At the beginning of our 2019 fiscal year, we began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of three business segments––P
fizerBiopharmaceuticals Group (Biopharma), Upjohn and, through 
July 31, 2019 , Consumer Healthcare. Biopharma and Upjohn are the only reportable segments. For additional information about this operating structure, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––
Note 17A. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information: Segment Information.
 See the “Our Strategy––Organizing for Growth” section of this Financial Review below and the “Commercial Operations” section in Part I, Item 1, “Business” of  our2019
 Form 10-K for additional information. The majority of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and highly regulated.
As a result, we face a number of industry-specific factors and challenges, which can significantly impact our results. These factors include, among others:
 the loss or expirationof intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights, the ability to replenish innovative biopharmaceutical products, healthcare legislation,
pipeline productivity, the regulatory environment, pricing and access pressures and competition. We also face challenges as a result of the global economic environment. For
additional information about these factors and challenges, see the “Our Operating Environment” and “The Global Economic Environment” sections of this Financial Review and
Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our 
2019  Form 10-K. The financial information included in our consolidated financial statements for our subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. is as of and for the year ended November 30 for each
year presented. Pfizer's fiscal year-end for U.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the year ended December 31 for each year presented.

References to developed and emerging markets in this Financial Review include:
Developed markets
 U.S., Western Europe, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Australia, Scandinaviancountries, Finland and New Zealand
 
   Emerging markets (include, but are not limited to) Asia (excluding Japan and South Korea), Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa,the Middle East, Central Europe and Turkey
References to operational variances in this Financial Review pertain to period-over-period growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange. The operational variances
are determined by multiplying or dividing, as appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiplying or
dividing, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year period average foreign exchange rates. Although exchange rate changes are part of our business, 
they are not withinour control. Exchange rate changes, however, can mask positive or negative trends in the business; therefore,
 we believe presenting operational variances provides usefulinformation to evaluate the results of our business.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted significant changes to
 U.S. tax law following the passage and signing of the TCJA. The TCJA is complex and significantly changesthe U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, reducing the U.
S. Federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, transitioning U.S. international taxation from aworldwide tax system to a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated accumulated post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
 For information on the TCJA, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––
Note 5A .  Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations.Our Business Development Initiatives
We are committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as through various forms of
business development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, mergers and acquisitions. We view
our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic
and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities.
 We continue to evaluate business development transactions that have the po tential to strengthen ourbusinesses and their capabilities, such as our acquisitions of Array, Therachon, Hospira, Medivation, Anacor and AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business, as
well as collaborations, and alliance and license agreements with other companies. We assess our businesses, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular,
ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will advance our businesses.
Our significant recent business development activities include:
•
License Agreement with Akcea Therapeutics, Inc.–– In October 2019, we entered into a worldwide exclusive licensing agreement for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, aninvestigational antisense therapy being developed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, with Akcea, a majority-owned affiliate of Ionis. The
transaction closed in November 2019 and we made an upfront payment of
 $250 million to Akcea and Ionis, which was recorded in Research and development expenses in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2019.
•
Formation of a New Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture––On July 31, 2019 , we completed the transaction in which we and GSK combined our respective consumerhealthcare businesses into a new consumer healthcare joint venture that operates globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name.
 The joint venture is a categoryleader in pain relief, respiratory and vitamins, minerals and supplements, and therapeutic oral health and is the largest global OTC consumer healthcare business.
 Inaccordance with our domestic and international reporting periods, our financial results, and our Consumer Healthcare segment’s operating results, for 2019 reflect seven
months of Consumer Healthcare segment domestic operations and eight months of Consumer Healthcare segment international operations. Assets and liabilities associated
with our Consumer Healthcare business were reclassified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.
 See Note 1A. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
: Basis of Presentation.•
Acquisition of Array BioPharma Inc.––On July 30, 2019 , we acquired Array for $48  per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred for Array wasapproximately 
$11.2 billion  ( $10.9 billion, net of cash acquired). Our financial statements for 2019 reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Array, commencing from the acquisition date
. •
Agreement to Combine Upjohn with Mylan N.V.–– On July 29, 2019, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to combine Upjohn with Mylan, creating anew global pharmaceutical company, Viatris. Under the terms of the agreement, which is structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction, Upjohn is expected to
be spun off or split off to Pfizer’s shareholders and, immediately thereafter, combined with Mylan.
 Pfizer shareholders would own 57%  of the combined new company, andformer Mylan shareholders would own 
43% . The transaction is expected to be tax free to Pfizer and Pfizer shareholders. The transaction is anticipated to close in mid-2020, subject to Mylan shareholder approval and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals.
 We expect to incur costs of approximately $500 million in connection with fully separating Upjohn, inclusive of 
$145 million  incurred in 2019. Such charges will include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and anticipated transaction costs.
•
Acquisition of Therachon Holding AG––On July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon for $340 million  upfront, plus potential milestone payments of up to 
$470 million, contingent on the achievement of key milestones in the development and commercialization of the lead asset. The total fair value of the considerationtransferred for Therachon was approximately
 $322 million. Our financial statements for 2019 reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Therachon,commencing from the acquisition date and, in accordance with our international reporting period, reflect five months of Therachon operations and cash flows.
•
Sale of Hospira Infusion Systems Net Assets to ICU Medical, Inc.–– On February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of Pfizer’s global infusion systems net assets, HIS, to ICUMedical for up to approximately
 $900 million, composed of cash and contingent cash consideration, ICU Medical common stock (all of which we sold during 2018) and sellerfinancing
. The operating results of HIS are included in our consolidated statement of income through February 2, 2017 and , therefore, our financial results for 2017 reflectone month of HIS domestic operations and two months of HIS international operations. 
Our financial results for 2019  and 2018  do not reflect any contribution from HIS global operations.
•
Acquisition of AstraZeneca’s Small Molecule Anti-Infectives Business––On December 22, 2016, which fell in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 for our international operations, we acquired the development and commercialization rights to AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives

business, primarily outside the U.S.
 for approximately $1.0 billion , composed of cash and contingent consideration. Our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of this business, commencing from the acquisition date and, in accordance with our international reporting period, for 2017 reflect
approximately 11 months of the small molecule anti-infectives business operations and cash flows acquired from AstraZeneca.

Industry-Specific Challenges
Intellectual Property Rights 
and Collaboration/Licensing RightsThe loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can
have a significant adverse effect on our revenues. 
Certain of our current products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face significantly increased generic competition over the next
 few years. For example, Lyrica lost patent protection in the U.S. in June 2019 and multi-source generic competition began in July 2019. Also, the basic product paten
t for Chantix in the U.S. will expire in November 2020. We expect the impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries will be significant in 2020, then moderating downward to a much lower level from 2021 through 2025.
For additional information, including the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole, together with the year in which the basic product
patent expires and recent and expected losses of product exclusivity, see the “Pa
tents and Other Intellectual Property Rights” section in Part I, Item 1, “Business” of our 2019 Form 10-K.

 For additional information, see the “Government Regulation and Price Constraints” section in Part I, Item 1, “Business”, of our2019
 Form 10-K. We recorded the following amounts as a result of the U.S. Healthcare Legislation:

2019 2018 2017 Reduction to 
Revenues , related to the Medicare “coverage gap” discount provision $ 934 $ 674 $ 450 Selling, informational and administrative expenses
, related to the fee payable to the federal government (which is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes), based on our prior-calendar-year share relative to other companies of
branded prescription drug sales to specified government programs. 2018 reflected a favorable true-up associated with
the updated 2017 invoice received from the federal government, which reflected a lower expense than what was
previously estimated for invoiced periods.
247 184 307 Regulatory Environment/P
ricing and Access––Government and Other Payer Group PressuresThe pricing of medicines by pharmaceutical manufacturers and the cost of healthcare, which includes medicines, medical services and hospital services, continues to be
important to payers, governments, patients, and other stakeholders. Governments, MCOs and o
ther payor groups continue to seek increasing discounts on our productsthrough a variety of means and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We believe that
 medicines are amongst the most powerful tools for patients incuring, treating and preventing illness and disability, and that all patients should have appropriate access to the medicines their doctors prescribe. We may consider a number
of factors when determining a medicine’s price, including, for example, its impact on patients and their disease, other available treatments, the medicine’s potential to reduce
other healthcare costs (such as hospital stays), and affordability. Within the U.S.,
 in particular, we may also engage with patients, doctors and healthcare plans regarding theirviews. We also negotiate with insurers, including PBMs and MCOs, often providing significant discounts to them from the list price. The price that
 patients pay in the U.S. forthe medicines their physicians prescribe is ultimately set by healthcare providers and insurers. On average, in the U.S., insurers impose a of higher out-of-pocket burden on
patients for prescription medicines than for comparably-priced medical services. We will continue to work with insurance providers, governments and others to improve access
to today’s innovative treatments. 
Certain governments, including the different EU member states, the U.K., China, Japan, Canada,  South Korea and some other internationalmarkets, provide healthcare at low-to-zero direct cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power as large single payers to regulate pharmaceutical prices or
patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system, particularly under recent global financing pressures.
 Governments may use avariety of cost-containment measures for our pharmaceutical products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a
condition of market access, “international reference pricing” (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), quality consistency
evaluation processes and volume-based procurement.
 For additional information, see the “Government Regulation and Price Constrains” section in Part I, Item 1, “Business” of our 
2019 Form 10-K. Regulatory Environment––Pipeline
 ProductivityThe discovery and development of safe, effective new products, as well as the development o
f additional uses for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength ofour businesses. We have encountered increasing regulatory scrutiny of drug safety and efficacy, even as we continue 
to gather safety and other data on our products, beforeand after the products have been launched. Our product lines must be replenished over time in order to offse
t revenue losses when products lose their market exclusivity, aswell as to provide for earnings growth. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities. These activities involve a high degree of risk and cost and may take many years,
and with respect to any specific R&D project, there can be no assurance that 
the development of any particular product candidate or new indication for an in-line product willachieve the desired clinical endpoints and safety profile, will be approved by regulators or will be successful commercially.
During the development of a product, we conduct clinical trials to provide data on the drug’s safety and ef
ficacy to support the evaluation of its overall benefit-risk profile for aparticular patient population. In addition, after a product has been approved and launched, we continue 
to monitor its safety as long as it is available to patients, andpostmarketing trials may be conducted, including trials requested by regulators and trials that we do voluntarily to gain additional medical knowledge. For the entire life of the
product, we collect safety data and report safety information to the
 FDA and other regulatory authorities. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions may evaluatepotential safety concerns related to a product or a class of products and 
take regulatory actions in response, such as updating a product’s labeling, restricting the use of aproduct, communicating new safety information to the public, or, in rare cases, removing a product from the market.
Product Manufacturing
We periodically encounter difficulties or delays in manufacturing, including due to suspension of manufacturing or recall of a product, or legal or regulatory actions such as
warning letters. For example, Hospira’s manufacturing facility in McPherson, Kansas is currently under the FDA inspection classification of Official Action Indicated (OAI). As a
result of this classification, the FDA may refuse to grant premarket approval of applications and/or the FDA may refuse
 to grant export certificates related to productsmanufactured at our McPherson site until the site status is upgraded, which upgrade would be based on a re-inspection by the
 FDA. Future FDA inspections and regulatoryactivities will further assess the adequacy and sustainability of corrections implemented at the site. Communication with the FDA on the status o
f the McPherson site is6

ongoing. For additional information regarding the FDA inspection of the McPherson site, see Part I, I
tem 1A, “Risk Factors––Product Manufacturing, Sales and MarketingRisks” of our 2019 Form 10-K.
We have been experiencing product shortages for products from the legacy Hospira portfolio, among others, largely driven by capacity constraints, technical issues, supplier
quality concerns or unanticipated demand. We have made considerable progress remediating issues at legacy Hospira facilities manufacturing sterile injectables and have
substantially improved supply from most of these sites. Continuing product shortage interruption at these and other manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial
results.
Competition
Many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilars that treat similar diseases or indications.
 For additional information, see the “Competition” section in Part I, Item 1, “Business” of our 
2019  Form 10-K. The Global Economic Environment
In addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses of our size, are exposed 
to the economic cycle, which impacts our biopharmaceuticaloperations globally.
•
Governments, corporations, and insurance companies, which provide insurance benefits to patients, have implemented increases in cost-sharing and restrictions on accessto medicines, potentially causing patients to switch to generic or biosimilar products, delay treatments, skip doses or use less effective treatments.
 As discussed above,government financing pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria (e.g.,
through public or private health technology assessments), or other means of cost control.
•
Significant portions of our revenues, costs and expenses, as well as our substantial international net assets, are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek tomanage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency
assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. Depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk also is managed through the use of derivative financial instruments and
foreign currency debt. As we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen, the Canadian dollar, the U.K. pound and
approximately 100 other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. If the U.S. dollar were to weaken against
another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would
increase, having a negative impact on earnings. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar were to strengthen against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant,
our revenues would decrease, having a negative impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact on earnings. Therefore, significant
changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.
The impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations, including Venezuela and Argentina, can
impact our results and financial guidance
. For additional information about our exposure to foreign currency risk, see the “Our Financial Guidance for 2020 ” and the “Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” sections of this Financial Review.

In June 2016, the U.K. electorate voted in a referendum to leave the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit”. In March 2017, the U.K. government formally notified the European Council of its intention to leave the EU after it triggered Article 50 of 
the Lisbon Treaty to begin the two-year negotiation process establishing the terms of the exitand outlining the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU. Formal negotiations of
ficially started in June 2017. Following the General Election in December 2019, thenew U.K. parliament approved the negotiated withdrawal agreement and the 
U.K. left the EU on January 31, 2020 with sta tus quo arrangements through a transition periodscheduled to end on December 31, 2020.
 The transition period will be used to negotiate future trade arrangements between the U.K. and the EU. The consequences of the U.K. leaving the EU and the terms of the fu
ture trading relationship continue to be highly uncertain, which may pose certain implications to our research, commercial andgeneral business operations in the U.K. and the EU, including the approval and supply of our products.
 At present, it is still unclear whether and to what extent the  U.K. willremain within or aligned to the EU system of medicines regulation, after the end of the transition period.
 However, both the U.K. and the EU have issued detailed guidance for the industry on how medicines, medical devices and clinical trials will be separately regulated in their respective territories. Pfizer has substantially completed its
preparations for Brexit, having made the changes necessary to meet relevant regulatory requirements in the EU and the U.K.
, through the transition period and afterwards,especially in the regulatory, research, manufacturing and supply chain areas. Between 2018 and 2021, we expect to spend up
 to approximately $60 million in one-time coststo make these adaptations.
We generated approximately 
2%  of our worldwide revenues from the U.K. in 2019  including the foreign currency exchange impact from the weakening U.K. pound relative to the U.S. dollar to date.
•
Public health epidemics or outbreaks could adversely impact our business. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province,China. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused significant disruptions to its economy, it has now spread to several other countries and
infections have been reported globally. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and
cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the
 actions tocontain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. In particular, the continued spread of 
the coronavirus globally could adversely impact our operations, includingamong others, our manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing and clinical trial operations and could have an adverse impact on our business and our financial
results.
Pfizer maintains a strong financial position while operating in a complex global environment. Due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital
markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the
foreseeable future. Our long-term debt is rated high quality by both S&P and Moody’s. 
As market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. We havetaken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. Both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid,
well-diversified,

available-for-sale debt securities. For further discussion of our financial condition and credit ratings, see the “Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources”
section of this Financial Review.
These and other industry-wide factors that may affect our businesses should be considered along with information presented in the “Forward-Looking Information and Factors
That May Affect Future Results” section of this Financial Review and in Part I, 
Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our 2019  Form 10-K. Our Strategy
We believe that our medicines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of diseases but also 
from a reductionin other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in health, wellness and productivity. We continue to actively engage in
dialogues about the value of our medicines and how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and 
treat disease and improve outcomes. We continueto work within the current legal and pricing structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers, to maximize patient access
and minimize any adverse impact on our revenues. We remain firmly committed to fulfilling our Company’s purpose: 
Breakthroughs that change patients’ lives . By doing so, we expect to create value for the patients we serve and for our colleagues and shareholders.
Organizing for Growth
We believe we have one of the strongest pipelines we have had in over a decade, and believe we are well positioned for future growth. 
Additional patent expiries will continueover several years, and we expect the impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries will be significant in 2020, then moderating downward to a much lower level from
2021 through 2025. This confluence of events has provided us an opportunity to
 look at and refine how we organize our business to best achieve sustainable growth and todeliver our medicines and vaccines to the maximum number of people who need them.
At the beginning of our fiscal year 2019, we began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of three businesses, each
 led by a singlemanager—Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group (Biopharma), Upjohn and, through July 31, 2019, Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare business. We designed this new global structure
to take advantage of new growth opportunities driven by the evolving and unique dynamics of relevant markets.
For additional information about each business, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––
Note 17A. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information: Segment Information.
We also reorganized our R&D operations as part of our Organizing for Growth reorganization:
•
The former Worldwide Research and Development organization is renamed Worldwide Research, Development and Medical (WRDM) as we have created a new WorldwideMedical & Safety organization in WRDM that incorporates the former Chief Medical Office as well as the Worldwide Safety function;
•
The R&D organization within our former Essential Health business has been integrated into the WRDM, GPD and Upjohn organizations, including moving biosimilars intoWRDM and GPD and realigning them with the relevant therapeutic areas (e.g., Oncology and Inflammation & Immunology);
•
The Regulatory function has been moved from the WRDM organization into the GPD organization; and•
Late-stage portfolio spend has been moved from our former Innovative Health business to GPD and from our former Essential Health business to GPD and Upjohn.We re-aligned our commercial operations in 2019 for a number of reasons, including:
•
Bringing biosimilars into our Oncology and Inflammation & Immunology therapeutic categories gives us the potential to leverage our R&D, regulatory and commercialinfrastructure within the Biopharma business to more efficiently bring those assets to market;
•
Creating a business unit (i.e., the Hospital unit within Biopharma) that is solely focused on medicines that are used in hospitals can potentially bring greater focus andattention to serving those customers and developing those relationships;
•
Giving Upjohn more autonomy with a focus on maximizing the value of its products, particularly in emerging markets, provides it the opportunity to operate as a standalonebusiness within Pfizer with the potential for sustainable modest growth; and
•
We believe this new structure better positions each business to achieve its growth potential as we transition to a period post-2020 where we expect higher and moresustained revenue growth due to declining LOEs and the potential of our late-stage pipeline.
Biopharma seeks to leverage a strong pipeline, organize around operational growth drivers, and capitalize on trends creating long-term growth opportunities, including:
•
an aging global population that is generating increased demand for innovative medicines that address patients’ unmet needs;•
advances in both biological science and digital technology that are enhancing the delivery of breakthrough new medicines; and•
the increasingly significant role of hospitals in healthcare systems.Urbanization and the rise of the middle class in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, provide growth opportunities for the Upjohn business. Our ability to work collaboratively
within local markets and to be fast, focused and flexible is intended to position this business to
 seize these opportunities. Upjohn has distinct and dedicated manufacturing,marketing, regulatory and, subject to limited exceptions, enabling functions that report directly into the business providing autonomy and positioning Upjohn to operate as a 
truestand-alone division. We created this new structure to, among other things, position Upjohn to optimize its distinct growth potential and provide us with 
the flexibility to accessfurther opportunities to enhance value.
Subsequent to the re-alignment of our commercial operations in 2019, on July 29, 2019, we announced that we en
tered into a definitive agreement to combine Upjohn withMylan, creating a new global pharmaceutical company, Viatris. For additional information, see the “Our Business Development Initiatives” section above in this Financial
Review. We believe the new company will transform and accelerate Upjohn’s
8
 
 2019 Financial Report
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
and Mylan’s ability to serve patients’ needs and expand their capabilities across more than 165 markets. The combination will drive a sustainable, diverse and differentiated
portfolio of prescription medicines, complex generics, over-the-counter products and biosimilars supported by commercial and regulatory expertise, established infrastructure,
R&D capabilities and manufacturing and supply chain excellence.
As we prepare for expected growth, we are focused on creating a simpler, more efficient organization by streamlining structures, processes and governance within each
business and the functions that support them. As our innovative pipeline matures based on an
ticipated progression of current trials and the initiation of new pivotal trials,including new trials for medicines we may acquire or in-license, we will need to increase our R&D investments. In addition, as our pipeline potentially delivers new
commercialization opportunities, we will need to increase our investments in new-market-creation activities. We have initiated an enterprise-wide digital effort to accelerate drug
development, enhance experiences (patient and physician) and access and leverage technology and robotics to simplify and automate our processes.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we took steps
 to simplify the organization, increase spans of control and reduce organizational layers, which impacted some managerial roles andresponsibilities. We also offered enhancements to certain employee benefits for a short period of time. The expenses related to 
these enhancements for certain employeebenefits did not have a material impact on our 2018 and 2019 results of operations.
Transforming to a More Focused Company
With the formation of the GSK Consumer Healthcare venture and the pending combination of Upjohn with Mylan, P
fizer is transforming itself into a more focused, global leaderin science-based innovative medicines. As a result, we began, in the fourth quarter of 2019, to
 identify and undertake efforts to ensure our cost base aligns appropriately withour Biopharmaceutical revenue base, which is expected to be 20% less (based on the midpoint of the range for 2020 New P
fizer revenue guidance (see the “Our FinancialGuidance for 2020” section of this Financial Review), compared to 2019 total company reported revenue) as a result of both the completed Consumer Healthcare and expected
Upjohn transactions. While certain direct costs have transferred or will transfer to the Consumer Healthcare joint venture and to the Upjohn entities, there are indirect costs
which are not expected to transfer. In addition, we are taking steps 
to restructure our organizations to appropriately support and drive the purpose of the three core functions ofour focused innovative medicines business: R&D, Manufacturing and Commercial. 
For additional information, see the “Costs and Expenses–– Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives
” section of this Financial Review. Commercial Operations
As discussed under “Organizing for Growth”, at the beginning of our 2019 fiscal year, we began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure
consisting of three business segments––Biopharma, Upjohn and, through July 31, 2019, Consumer Healthcare, each led by a single manager. Each operating segment has
responsibility for its commercial activities. Upjohn, and through July 31, 2019, Consumer Healthcare are responsible for their own R&D activities while Biopharma receives its
R&D services from GPD and WRDM. These services include IPR&D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products. Each business has
a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets.
 For additional information on our Commercial Operations, see the “Commercial Operations” section in Part I, Item 1, “Business” of our 
2019  Form 10-K. For additional information about our operating structure, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 17A. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information
: Segment Information. For additional information about the 2019  performance of each of our operating segments, see the “Analysis of Operating Segment Information” section of this Financial Review.
Description of Research and
 Development OperationsInnovation is critical to the success of our Company, and drug discovery and development are time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable.
 Pfizer’s purpose is to deliverbreakthroughs that change patients’ lives.
 R&D is at the heart of fulfilling Pfizer’s purpose as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the  therapies thatmatter most.
Our R&D priorities include:
•
delivering a pipeline of highly differentiated medicines and vaccines where Pfizer has a unique opportunity to bring the most important new therapies to patients in need;•
advancing our capabilities that can position Pfizer for long-term R&D leadership; and•
advancing new models for partnerships with creativity, flexibility and urgency to deliver innovation to patients as quickly as possible.To that end, our R&D primarily focuses on:

Intellectual Property Rights
We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against increasingly aggressive infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen
 worldwide recognition ofpatent rights while taking necessary steps to ensure appropriate patient access. In addition, we will continue to employ innovative approaches designed to prevent
 counterfeitpharmaceuticals from entering the supply chain and to achieve greater control over the distribution of our products, and we will continue to participate in the generics market
whenever appropriate. Also, 
the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by other companies that we believe were improperly granted. Such challenges may include negotiation and litigation, which may not always be successful.

. Increasing Investment in the U.S.
––After evaluating the expected positive net impact the TCJA will have on us, in early 2018,  we decided to take several actions:•
Over the five-year period from 2018 through 2022, we plan to invest approximately $5.0 billion in capital projects in the U.S., including the strengthening of our manufacturingpresence in the U.S. As part of this plan:
◦
in July 2018, we announced that we will increase our commitment to U.S. manufacturing with a $465 million investment to build one of the most technically advancedsterile injectable pharmaceutical production facilities in the world in Portage, Michigan. This U.S. investment will strengthen our capability to produce and supply critical,
life-saving injectable medicines for patients around the world, creating an estimated 450 new jobs over the next several years; and
◦
in August 2019, we announced an additional half billion dollar investment for the construction of a state-of-the-art gene therapy manufacturing facility in Sanford, NorthCarolina. This facility is anticipated to support our continuing investment in gene therapy R&D, similar to Pfizer’s Chapel Hill and Kit Creek, North Carolina R&D sites. This
facility would expand our presence in North Carolina. The expanded facility is projected to add approximately 300 new jobs.
•
We made a $500 million voluntary contribution to the U.S. Pfizer Consolidated Pension Plan in February 2018.•
In the first quarter of 2018, we paid a special, one-time bonus to virtually all Pfizer colleagues, excluding executives, of $119 million  in the aggregate. Our Business Development I
nitiativesAs part of our strategy, we are also committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as
through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, mergers
and acquisitions. For additional information see the “Our Business Development Initiatives” section of this Financial Review above and Notes to Consolidated Financial

$8.1 to $8.5 billion Adjusted other (income)/deductions
Approximately $800 million of income Effective tax rate on adjusted income
Approximately 15.0% Adjusted diluted EPS
$2.82 to $2.92 (a)
 The 2020 financial guidance for Total Com pany reflects the following:•
Reflects a full year of revenue and expense contributions from Biopharma and Upjohn,  and excludes any impact from the pending Upjohn combination with Mylan.•
Does not assume the completion of any business development transactions not completed as of December 31, 2019 , including any one-time upfront payments associated with such transactions.•
Includes Pfizer’s pro rata share of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture anticipated earnings, which is recorded in Adjusted other (income)/deductions on a one-quarter lag. Therefore, 2020 financial guidancefor Adjusted other (income)/de
ductions and Adjusted diluted EPS reflects Pfizer’s share of the joint venture’s earnings that were generated in the fourth quarter of 2019 (to be recorded by Pfizer in the firstquarter of 2020) as well as Pfizer’s s
hare of the joint venture’s projected earnings during the first three quarters of 2020.•
Reflects an anticipated negative revenue impact of $2.4 billion  due to recent and expected generic and biosimilar competition for certain products that have recently lost or are anticipated to soon lose patentprotection.
•
Exchange rates assumed are as of mid-January 2020. Reflects the anticipated unfavorable impact of approximately $0.2 billion  on revenues and approximatel y $0.01  on adjusted diluted EPS as a result of changes in foreign excha
nge rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared to foreign exchange rates from 2019.•
Guidance for adjusted diluted EPS assumes diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 5.65  billion shares, which assumes no share repurchases in 2020. (b)
 For additional information regarding an understanding of Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS (all of which are non-GAAP financial measures), see the “Non-GAAP Financial Measure(Adjusted Income)” section of this Fina
ncial Review.Beginning in 2020, Upjohn began managing Pfizer’s Meridian subsidiary, the manufacturer of EpiPen and other auto-injector products, and the Mylan-Japan collaboration for
generic drugs in Japan (established in 2012) (Mylan-Japan). As a result, revenues and expenses associated with Meridian and Mylan-Japan will be reported in Pfizer’s Upjohn
business beginning in the first quarter of 2020. In 2019, revenues from Meridian and Mylan-Japan were recorded in Pfizer’s Biopharma business and totaled 
$598  million, flat operationally, compared with full-year 2018.
Pfizer, Upjohn and Mylan are in the process of negotiating the terms on which Pfizer would transfer the Meridian business and/or certain Pfizer assets tha
t currently form partof the Mylan-Japan collaboration to Viatris following the completion of the proposed combination of Upjohn and Mylan. There can be no assurance that any agreement or
transaction will result from these negotiations and if the parties are unsuccessful in their efforts to negotiate 
the terms of such potential transactions, the Meridian businessand/or the Pfizer assets that currently form part of the Mylan-Japan collaboration will remain with Pfizer.
2020 Financial Guidance for New Pfizer
2020 financial guidance for New Pfizer is presented below

$40.7 to $42.3 billion Adjusted IBT Margin
(c)Approximately 37.0%Adjusted Diluted EPS
$2.25 to $2.35 Operating Cash Flow
(d)$11.0 to $12.0 billion(a)
 Financial guidance for New Pfizer reflects a full-year 2020 pro-forma view of the company assuming the pending Upjohn combination with Mylan was completed at the beginning of 2020. Therefore, New Pfizerreflects contributions from the Biop
harma business as it is presently being managed, which excludes contributions from Pfizer’s Meridian subsidiary and the Pfizer-Mylan strategic collaboration in Japan (Mylan-Japan). Pfizer’s Meridian subsidiary 
and Mylan-Japan were managed by Pfizer’s Biopharma business in 2019. Financial guidance for New Pfizer also includes the full-year effect of the following items that assumethe completion of the Upjoh
n combination with Mylan: (i) $12 billion of net proceeds from Upjohn to be retained by Pfizer, which Pfizer will use to repay its own existing indebtedness; and (ii) other transaction-related items, such as income from tra
nsition services agreements between Pfizer and Viatris. In addition, 2020 financial guidance for New Pfizer Adjusted IBT Margin and Adjusted diluted EPS reflects Pfizer’sshare of the earnings ge
nerated by the Consumer Healthcare joint venture in fourth-quarter 2019 (to be recorded by Pfizer in first-quarter 2020) as well as Pfizer’s share of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture’sprojected earnings during the
 first three quarters of 2020.(b)
 For additional information regarding an understanding of Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS (all of which are non-GAAP financial measures), see the “Non-GAAP Financial Measure(Adjusted Income)” section of this Fina

 Adjusted income before tax margin (Adjusted IBT margin) is defined as revenue less the sum of Adjusted cost of sales, Adjusted SI&A expenses, Adjusted R&D expenses, Adjusted amortization of intangibleassets and Adjusted other (inc
ome)/deductions as a percentage of revenue. Adjusted IBT Margin is presented because management believes this performance measure supplements investors’ and other readers’understanding and ass
essment of the financial performance of New Pfizer. Adjusted IBT margin is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S. GAAP income before tax margin.(d)
 Does not include our planned $1.25 billion  voluntary contribution to the U.S. qualified pension plans in the second half of 2020.2020 Financial Guidance for Upjohn
2020 financial guidance for Upjohn now reflects the inclusion of revenues and expenses associated with Meridian and Mylan-Japan, which were previously recorded in Pfizer’s
Biopharma business. Except for the shift of Meridian and Mylan-Japan from Biopharma to Upjohn, there are no operational changes to Upjohn’s 2020 financial guidance
compared with the preliminary financial targets that were provided in July 2019.

 Financial guidance for Upjohn assumes a full-year 2020 contribution from the Upjohn business as it is presently being managed, which includes contributions from Pfizer’s Meridian subsidiary and Mylan-Japan.(b)
 Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) is defined as reported U.S. GAAP net income/(loss), and its components, adjusted for interest expense, provision/(benefit) fortaxes on income/(loss) and de

he completion of joint venture transactions, restructuring charges, legal charges or net gains and losses on equity securities, but which management does not believe arereflective of ongoing core o
perations). Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes this performance measure supplements investors’ and other readers’ understanding and assessment of thefinancial performance of Upjo
hn. Adjusted EBITDA as defined is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss) or cash flow fromoperations determined in ac
cordance with GAAP.Pfizer does not provide guidance for GAAP Reported financial measures (other than revenues) or a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most
directly comparable GAAP Reported financial measures on a forward-looking basis because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of pending
litigation, unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, net gains or losses on investments in equity securities and potential future asset impairments without

themost complex judgments: Acquisitions (Note 1D); Fair Value (Note 1E); Revenues (Note 1G); Asset Impairments (Note 1L); Tax Assets and Liabilities and
 Income TaxContingencies (Note 1P); Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans (Note 1Q); and Legal and Environmental Contingencies (Note 1R).
Following is a discussion about the critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting our consolidated financial statements. See also Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements––

: Plan Assets . For a discussion about the application of fair value to our asset impairment reviews, see “Asset Impairment Reviews” below.
Revenues
Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the
 revenues are recognized. Suchvariable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such,
knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
Historically, our adjustments of estimates, to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not
 been material to our overall business. On a quarterly basis, ouradjustments of estimates to reflect actual results generally have been less than 1% of revenues,
 and have resulted in either a net increase or a net decrease in revenues.Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends.
 If any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. The sensitivity of our estimates can vary by
 program, typeof customer and geographic location. However, estimates associated with U.S. Medicare, Medicaid and performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material
adjustment because of the extensive time delay between the recording of the accrual and its ultimate se
ttlement, an interval that can generally range up to one year. Becauseof this time lag, in any given quarter, our adjustments to actual can incorporate revisions of several prior quarters.

Asset Impairment Reviews
We review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least
annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the
amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets. Our impairment review processes are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements––
Note 1L. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Amortization of  Intangible Assets, Depreciation and Certain Long-Lived Assets.Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include:
•
A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset. For example, a successful challenge of our patent rights wouldlikely result in generic competition earlier than expected.
•
A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. For example, restrictions imposed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities could affect ourability to manufacture or sell a product.
•
A projection or forecast that indicates losses or reduced profits associated with an asset. This could result, for example, from a change in a government reimbursementprogram that results in an inability to sustain projected product revenues and profitability. This also could result from the introduction of a competitor’s product that results in
a significant loss of market share or the inability to achieve the previously projected revenue growth, as well as the lack of acceptance of
 a product by patients, physiciansand payers. For IPR&D projects, this could result from, among other things, a change in outlook based
 on clinical trial data, a delay in the projected launch date or additionalexpenditures to commercialize the product.
Identifiable Intangible Assets
As a result of our identifiable intangible asset impairment review work, we recognized a number of impairments of identifiable intangible assets for the years ended
December 31, 2019
, 2018 and 2017 . See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– Note 4. Other (Income)/Deductions — Net.When we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill, we use an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method. We s
tartwith a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the
 asset, which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinite-lived assets, and then we apply anasset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of 
the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount andtiming of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on 
the projections and the impact of technological riskassociated with IPR&D assets, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount
 rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cashflows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash
 flows.While all intangible assets other than goodwill can face events and circumstances that can lead to impairment, in general, intangible assets other than goodwill that are most at
risk of impairment include IPR&D assets (approximately 
$5.9 billion  as of December 31, 2019 ) and newly acquired or recently impaired indefinite-lived brand assets. IPR&D assets are high-risk assets, as R&D is an inherently risky activity. Newly acquired and recently impaired indefinite-lived assets are more vulnerable to impairment as the assets
are recorded at fair value and are then subsequently measured at the lower of fair value or carrying value at the end of each
 reporting period. As such, immediately afteracquisition or impairment, even small declines in the outlook for these assets can negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment
charge.
Goodwill
As a result of our goodwill impairment review work, we concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired as of 
December 31, 2019 , and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at this time.
We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the 
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors that weconsider include, for example, macroeconomic and industry conditions, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events. If we conclude that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then
 perform a quantitative fair value test.When we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, as appropriate for the individual reporting unit, we mainly use the income approach but we may also use
the market approach, or a weighted-average combination of both approaches.
•
The income approach is a forward-looking approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on internal forecasts. Within the income approach, the method that we use isthe discounted cash flow method. We start with a forecast of
 all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit, which includes the application of a terminalvalue, and then we apply a reporting unit-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. 
Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent inthis approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected
 impact of technological risk and competitive, legal and/orregulatory forces on the projections, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks 
to reflect the various risks inherent in the projectedcash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the
 projected cash flows.•
The market approach is a historical approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on external information. Within the market approach are two methods that we mayuse:
◦
Guideline public company method—this method employs market multiples derived from market prices of stocks of companies that are engaged in the same or similar linesof business and that are actively traded on a free and open market and 
the application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit’sfinancial performance.
2019 Financial Report    
 
 13
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
◦
Guideline transaction method—this method relies on pricing multiples derived from transactions of significant interests in companies engaged in the same or similar linesof business and the application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit’s financial performance.
The market approach is only appropriate when the available external information is robust and deemed to be a reliable proxy for the specific reporting unit being valued;
however, these assessments may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: 
theselection of appropriate guideline companies and transactions and the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in ownership
percentages, ownership rights, business ownership forms or marketability between the reporting unit and the guideline companies and transactions.
For all of our reporting units, there are a number of future events and factors tha
t may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome ofsubsequent goodwill impairment testing. For a list of these factors, see the “Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affec
t Future Results” section of this FinancialReview and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 
2019  Form 10-K. Benefit Plans
The majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we sponsor bo
th IRC-qualified andsupplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for
retirees and their eligible dependents.
The accounting for benefit plans is highly dependent on actuarial estimates, assumptions and calculations, which can result from a complex series of judgments about fu
tureevents and uncertainties. The assumptions and actuarial estimates required to estimate the net employee benefit obligations for the
 defined benefit and postretirement plansinclude the discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality (life expectancy); and healthcare cost
trend rates.
Effective January 1, 2018, accruals for future benefits under the
 Pfizer Consolidated Pension Plan (our largest U.S. defined benefit plan) and the defined benefit section of thePfizer Group Pension Scheme (our largest pension plan in the U.K.) were frozen and resulted in elimination of future service costs for the plans.
 The Pfizer defined contributionsavings plan provides additional annual contributions to those previously accruing benefits under the Pfizer Consolidated Pension Plan and active members of the Pfizer Group
Pension Scheme started accruing benefits under the defined contribution section of that
 plan.As of 
December 31, 2019 , the noncurrent portion of our pension benefit obligations, net, increased by approximately $326 million , compared to December 31, 2018 . The increase reflects, among other things, a decrease in the discount rate used in the measurement of plan obligations, partially offse
t by an increase in the actual returns on planassets. As of December 31, 2019, the noncurrent portion of our pos
tretirement benefit obligations, net decreased by approximately $247 million , compared to December 31, 2018. The decrease reflects, among other things, plan amendments related to the prescription drug coverage in our U.S. and
 Puerto Rico Postretirement Plans and changes tothe claim cost assumptions, partially offset by the decrease in discount rate. For additional information, see Notes to
 Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 11C. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans
: Obligations and Funded Status. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and our judgment regarding future expectations that have been deemed reasonable by management. The judgments made
in determining the costs of our benefit plans can materially impact our results of operations.
The following table provides (i) at the end of each year, the expected annual rate of return on
 plan assets for the following year, (ii) the actual annual rate of return on planassets achieved in each year, and (iii) the weighted-average discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations at the end o
f each year for our U.S. qualified pension plansand our international pension plans

Expected Annual Rate of Return on Plan Assets
The assumptions for the expected annual rate of return on all of our plan assets reflect
 our actual historical return experience and our long-term assessment of forward-lookingreturn expectations by asset classes, which is used to develop a weighted-average expected return based on the implementation of our 
targeted asset allocation in ourrespective plans.
The expected annual rate of return on plan assets for our U.S. plans and
 the majority of our international plans is applied to the fair value of plan assets at each year-end andthe resulting amount is reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs to a 50 basis point decline in our assumption for the
 expected annual rate of return on plan assets,holding all other assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):

Expected annual rate of return on plan assets
  50 basis point decline  $110 The actual return on plan assets was approximately 
$3.7 billion  during 2019 . Discount Rate Used to Measure Plan Obligations
The weighted-average discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined at least annually and evaluated
 and modified, asrequired, to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or be
tter, that reflect the rates at which the pension benefitscould be effectively settled. The discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our international plans is determined at least
 annually by reference to investment gradecorporate bonds, rated AA/Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient da
ta, a yield-curve approach. These discount rate determinations are made in consideration of localrequirements.
The measurement of the plan obligations at the end of the year will affect 
the amount of service cost, interest cost and amortization expense reflected in our net periodic benefitcosts in the following year.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs and benefit obligations to a 10 basis point
 decline in our assumption for the discount rate, holding allother assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):

     Increase  Increase Discount rate
  10 basis point decline  $4  $461 The change in the discount rates used in measuring our plan obligations as of 
December 31, 2019  resulted in an increase  in the measurement of our aggregate plan obligations by approximately 
$3.2 billion . Income Tax Assets and Liabilities
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an estimate of certain 
tax effects of the TCJA, including (i) the impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities from the reduction in theU.S. Federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 
21% , (ii) the impact on valuation allowances and other state income tax considerations, (iii) a repatriation tax liability onaccumulated post-1986 foreign earnings for which we elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, payment over eight years through
2026, and (iv) deferred taxes on basis differences expected to give rise to future taxes
 on global intangible low-taxed income. In addition, we had provided deferred taxliabilities in the past on foreign earnings that were not indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the TCJA, in 
the fourth quarter of 2017, we reversed an estimate of the deferredtaxes that are no longer expected to be needed due to
 the change to the territorial tax system.The TCJA subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staf
f Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5,Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income
, states that we are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes  for temporary basisdifferences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years or provide for the tax expense related to such income in the year the
 tax is incurred. Weelected to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years. We were able to make a reasonable
estimate of the deferred taxes on the temporary differences expected to
 reverse in the future and provided a provisional deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017.In 2018, we finalized our provisional accounting for the tax effects of the
 TCJA based on our best estimates of available information and data, and reported and disclosed theimpacts within the applicable measurement period, in accordance with guidance issued by the SEC. We believe that there may be additional interpretations, clarifications and
guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury. Any change to our calculations resulting from such additional interpretations, clarifications and guidance would be reflected in
the period of issuance. In addition, our obligations may vary as a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and
/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and othercredit carryforwards. The current portion of the aforementioned repatriation tax liability is reported in current 
Income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 (approximately $600 million due in April 2020) and the remaining liability is reported in noncurrent 
Other taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. The first installment of $750 million was paid in April 2019.
Income tax assets and liabilities also include income tax valuation allowances and accruals for uncertain tax positions. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated

By total revenues, the U.S., China and Japan are our three largest na
tional markets:
Inventory Stocking
Our policy relating to the supply of pharmaceutical inventory at domestic wholesalers, and in major international markets, is to generally maintain stocking levels under one
month on average and to keep monthly levels consistent from year to year based on patterns o
f utilization. We historically have been able to closely monitor these customerstocking levels by purchasing information from our customers directly or by obtaining other third-party information. We believe our data sources to be directionally reliable but
cannot verify their accuracy. Further, as we do not control this third-party data, we cannot be
 assured of continuing access. Unusual buying patterns and utilization are promptlyinvestigated.
Revenue Deductions
Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the
 revenues are recognized. Suchvariable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of related obligations and, as such,
knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. 
Historically, our adjustments of estimates, to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business. On
 a quarterly basis, our adjustments of estimates to reflect actual resultsgenerally have been less than 1% of revenues, and have resulted in either a net increase or a net decrease in revenues.
 Product-specific rebates, however, can have asignificant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends.
The following table provides information about revenue deductions:
  
  Year Ended December 31, (MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)
  2019  2018  2017 Medicare rebates
(a)  $1,306  $1,706  $1,316 Medicaid and related state program rebates
(a)  1,936  1,969  1,860 Performance-based contract rebates
(a), (b)  3,767  3,377  3,245 Chargebacks
(c)  5,588  6,461  6,047 Sales allowances
(d)  5,678  5,592  5,165 Sales returns and cash discounts
  1,315  1,522  1,493 Total
(e)  $19,589  $20,627  $19,126 (a)
 Rebates are product-specific and, therefore, for any given year are impacted by the mix of products sold.(b)
 Performance-based contract rebates include contract rebates with MCOs within the U.S., including health maintenance organizations and PBMs, who receive rebates based on the achievement of contractedperformance terms and claims un
der these contracts. Outside the U.S., performance-based contract rebates include rebates to wholesalers/distributors based on achievement of contracted performance forspecific products or sales milestones.
(c)
 Chargebacks primarily represent reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties.(d)
 Sales allowances primarily represent price reductions that are contractual or legislatively mandated outside the U.S., discounts and distribution fees.(e)
 For 2019, associated with the following se gments: Biopharma ($12.0 billion ), Upjohn ( $7.2 billion ) and Other ( $0.4 billion ). For 2018 , associated with the following se gments: Biopharma ($10.2 billion ), Upjohn (
$9.7 billion) and Other ( $0.7 billion ). For 2017 , associated with the following se gments: Biopharma ($9.2 billion ), Upjohn ( $9.2 billion ) and Other ( $0.7 billion ). Total revenue deductions for 
2019  decreased 5% compared to 2018 , primarily as a result of: •
a decrease in chargebacks primarily related to Upjohn products, including Viagra and Lyrica; and•
a decrease in Medicare rebates, driven by a significant decrease in Lyrica sales in the U.S. due to multi-source generic competition that began in July 2019,partially offset by:
•
an increase in performance-based contract rebates, primarily in the U.S. due to increased sales of certain Biopharma products, slightly offset by decreased Lyrica sales.For information on our accruals for Medicare rebates, Medicaid and related state program rebates, performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and
sales returns and cash discounts, including the balance sheet classification of these accruals, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––

2019 : (MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)
  Worldwide   U.S.   International Operational growth/(decline):
         Continued growth from certain key brands
(a)  $2,495  $914  $1,581 Higher revenue from continued growth of anti-infective products in China, driven by increased demand for
Sulperazon and new launches, the 2018 U.S. launches of our immune globulin intravenous products
(Panzyga and Octagam) and the launches of certain anti-infectives products (Zavicefta, Zinforo and
Cresemba) in international developed and emerging markets, all in the Hospital products business
  472  174  298 Higher revenues for Inlyta, primarily in the U.S. driven by increased demand resulting from the second
quarter of 2019 U.S. FDA approvals for the combinations of certain immune checkpoint inhibitors plus Inlyta
for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC
  190  175  14 Higher revenues for Biosimilars, primarily in the U.S.
  168  185  (17 )Higher revenues for rare disease products driven by the U.S. launches in May 2019 of Vyndaqel and in
September 2019 of Vyndamax, for the treatment of 
transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM); andin international markets, primarily driven by continued uptake for the transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy
indication, primarily in developed Europe, as well as the March 2019 launch of the ATTR-CM indication in
Japan, partially offset by lower revenues for certain rare disease products, including the hemophilia
franchises (Refacto AF/Xyntha and BeneFIX), primarily due to competitive pressures, and Genotropin in
developed markets, mainly due to unfavorable channel mix in the U.S.
  159  108  51 Volume-driven growth from Celebrex and Effexor, primarily in Japan and China
  78  (8 ) 87 Lower worldwide revenues for Lyrica, primarily in the U.S., reflecting the expected significantly lower volumes
associated with multi-source generic competition that began in July 2019

Healthcare joint venture transaction with GSK. As a result, 2019 revenues reflect seven months
 ofConsumer Healthcare segment domestic operations and eight months of Consumer Healthcare segment
international operations
  (1,436 )  (889 ) (547 )Lower revenues from other Hospital products, primarily reflecting declines in developed markets, mostly due
to the continued expected negative impact from generic competition for products that have previously lost
marketing exclusivity
  (447 ) (200 ) (247 )Lower revenues for Enbrel internationally, reflecting continued biosimilar competition in most developed
Europe markets
  (292 ) —  (292 )Lower revenues for Viagra and Upjohn's authorized generic for Viagra in the U.S. resulting from increased
generic competition following Viagra's December 2017 patent expiration, partially offset by increased retail
demand growth in China
  (171 ) (193 ) 21 Decline in revenues for Revatio driven by lower U.S. Oral Suspension formulation sales and pricing
pressures due to a recent generic entry, and for Relpax, driven by continued generic competition across
developed markets
  (149 ) (110 ) (39 )Decline in Norvasc and Lipitor due to pricing pressures from the implementation of the VBP in certain cities in
China and lower volumes in Japan, partially offset by overall increased demand in China in the first quarter
of 2019 and continued geographic expansion in China during the second half of 2019 in provinces where
the VBP had not yet been implemented

Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 (Biopharma):  
  Year Ended December 31,  
        % Change (MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)
  2019  2018  Total  Oper. U.S.
  $3,209  $3,360  (4 )  International
  2,638  2,443  8  12 Worldwide revenues
  $5,847  $5,802  1  3 The 
decline in 2019 in the U.S. primarily reflects the continued decline in revenues for the adult indication due to a high initial capture rate of the eligible population followingits successful fourth-quarter 2014 launch, which resulted in a smaller remaining “catch up” opportunity (i.e., the opportunity to reach adults aged 65 years and older who
have not been previously vaccinated with Prevnar 13) as well as lower government purchases for the pediatric indication.
The operational 
growth  in 2019 internationally was primarily driven by the pediatric indication due to higher volumes reflecting continued uptake in China, favorable impact of timing and increased volumes associated with government purchases for the pediatric indication in certain emerging markets and higher volumes resulting from
increased shipments associated with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
In 2014, the ACIP voted to recommend Prevnar 13 for routine use
 to help protect adults aged 65 years and older against pneumococcal disease, which for adults includespneumonia caused by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine. These ACIP recommendations were subsequently approved by the directors at the
 CDCand U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and were published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in September 2014 by the CDC. The CDC regularly
monitors the impact of vaccination and reviews the recommendations. During the February 2019 ACIP meeting, the CDC presented a formal evaluation of evidence to the
recommendation framework (grading) for ACIP’s input. On June 26, 2019, the ACIP voted to
 revise the pneumococcal vaccination guidelines and recommend Prevnar 13for adults 65 and older based on the shared clinical decision making of the provider and patient, which means the decision to vaccinate should be made at
 the individuallevel between health care providers and their patients, maintaining reimbursement. The recommendation reaffirms that there remains vaccine preventable pneumococcal
disease in the population of adults 65 years or older, which may be prevented through direct vaccination. The ACIP’s recommendation was approved by the directors at
 theCDC and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and published by the CDC in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 While theACIP’s latest recommendation did not have an impact on Prevnar 13 revenues in 2019, due to 
timing of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report publication, we expectPrevnar 13 revenues from the adult indication to continue to decline in 2020 and beyond.

  1,710  1,196  43  53 Worldwide revenues
  $4,961  $4,118  20  23 The operational 
growth  in 2019 in international markets reflects the continued strong uptake in developed Europe and Japan as well as in certain emerging markets following launches, partially offset by pricing pressure primarily in certain developed Europe markets beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 
growth  in 2019 in the U.S. was mainly driven by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) class share growth and Ibrance’s continued CDK class share leadership in its approved metastatic breast cancer
indications.

Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales (Biopharma): Eliquis has been jointly developed and is commercialized by Pfizer and BMS. Pfizer funds between 50% and 60% of all development costs depending on the study. Profits and losses are shared equally on a
 global basis, except in certain countries where Pfizer commercializesEliquis and pays BMS compensation based on a percentage of net sales. We have
 full commercialization rights in certain smaller markets. BMS supplies the product to usat cost plus a percentage of the net sales to
 end-customers in these markets. Eliquis is part of the Novel Oral Anticoagulant market; the agents in this class were developedas alternative treatment options to warfarin in appropriate patients.

  606  380  59  70 Worldwide revenues
  $2,242  $1,774  26  29 The 
growth in the U.S. in 2019  was primarily due to continued growth in the RA indication driven by access improvements, and by volume growth from the launches of the UC and PsA indications in 2018, partially offset by higher rebating from new commercial contracts.
The operational 
growth  internationally in 2019  was mainly driven by continued uptake in the RA indication in developed Europe, emerging markets, Japan and Canada as well as from the recent launch of the UC indication in certain developed markets.
In July and December 2019, the FDA updated the U.S. prescribing information for Xeljanz to include three additional boxed warnings as well as changes to 
the indicationand dosing for UC. In January 2020, the EC revised the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for Xeljanz to include new warnings and recommendations for use of
Xeljanz due to an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, and, due to an increased risk of infections, revised warnings in patients older than 65 years of age.
 Theseupdates were based on the FDA’s and EMA’s review of 10 mg data from the ongoing post-marketing requirement RA study A3921133
. We expect these updates tomoderate growth. See the “Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Income—Product Development—Biopharmaceuticals” section of this Financial Review.

2019  due to continued volume growth in the U.S., as well as in certain developed markets in Europe and Canada, offset by pricing pressures globally as well as competitive pressures internationally.
The 
growth in the U.S. in 2019 was primarily driven by demand in open systems, partially offset by price erosion. While Inflectra has achieved parity access to Remicade ®(infliximab) in Medicare Part B, nearly half of all commercial patients are not able to access Inflectra due to exclusionary contracting practices by J&J. In Sep
tember 2017,Pfizer filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against J
&J alleging that J&J’s exclusionary contracts and other anticompetitive practicesconcerning Remicade violate federal antitrust laws. In June 2019, Pfizer received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) seeking

 In May 2012, the FDA’s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee voted that the tafamidis meglumine data provide substantial evidence of efficacy for a surrogate endpoint that isreasonably likely to predict a clinic
al benefit. In June 2012, the FDA issued a “complete response” letter with respect to this tafamidis NDA. The FDA has requested the completion of a second efficacy study, andalso has asked for addition
al information on the data within the current tafamidis NDA. Pfizer has completed study B3461028, a global Phase 3 study to support the new indication of transthyretin amyloidcardiomyopathy, which includes 
patients with wild type and variant transthyretin. We are working with the FDA to identify next steps.2019 Financial Report

An oral PARP inhibitor, in combinatio n with Xtandi (enzalutamide), for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancerIn November 2019, we and our partner Merck KGaA, Germany, announced the topline results of 
the Phase III JAVELIN Gastric 100 study evaluating avelumab as first-linemaintenance therapy following induction chemotherapy in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or gastroesophageal junction
cancer versus continuation of chemotherapy or best supportive care. While the study showed clinical activity for avelumab in this setting, it did not
 meet the primary endpointsof superior overall survival compared with the standard of care in the overall intent-to-treat population. No new safety signals were observed, and the safety profile for
avelumab in this trial was consistent with that observed in the overall JAVELIN clinical development program.
In February 2019, the company took steps to transition rheumatoid arthritis study patients who were on 
tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily to tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily in the ongoingFDA post-marketing requirement study A3921133, a study performed in patients considered to be at high risk for certain side effec
ts. This action was taken as the result ofnotification from the tofacitinib Rheumatology Data Safety Monitoring Board of a safety signal regarding the to
facitinib 10 mg twice daily treatment arm in study A3921133. The5 mg twice daily dose is the FDA approved dose in the U.S. for adult patients
 with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. In July 2019, the FDA updated the U.S. prescribinginformation for Xeljanz to include two additional boxed warnings as well as changes to the indication and dosing for UC. These updates were based on the FDA’s review of
data from the ongoing post-marketing requirement RA study A3921133. In January 2020, the 
EC revised the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for Xeljanz to includenew warnings and recommendations for use of Xeljanz due to an increased risk of venous thromboembolism and, due to an increased risk of infections, revised warnings in
patients older than 65 years of age. These updates were based on the
 FDA’s and EMA’s review of data from the ongoing post-marketing requirement rheumatoid arthritis studyA3921133.

Amortization of intangible assets 
increased  $135 million, or 3%, in 2018, compared to 2017 , primarily due to amortization expense of approximately $151 million (pre-tax) in 2018 associated with the approval of Xtandi in the U.S. for 
the treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The U.S. approval resulted in the transfer of$2.7 billion
 from an indefinite-lived IPR&D intangible asset to a finite-lived Developed technology rights intangible asset. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—

Indicates calculation not meaningful or result is equal to or greater than 100%.2017-2019 Initiatives and Organizing for Growth
During 2018, we determined that at the start of our 2019 fiscal year, we would begin operating under our new commercial structure, which reorganized our operations into three
businesses
–– Biopharma, a science-based innovative medicines business; Upjohn, a global, primarily off-patent branded and generic established medicines business; andthrough July 31, 2019, a Consumer Healthcare business. To operate effectively in this structure and position ourselves for future growth,
 we focused on creating a simpler,more efficient operating structure within each business as well as the functions that support them. Beginning in the
 fourth quarter of 2018, we reviewed previously plannedinitiatives and new initiatives to ensure that there was alignment around our new structure and combined the 2017-2019 initiatives with our current Organizing for Growth
initiatives to form one cohesive plan. For the combined programs, we achieved savings of approximately 
$1.6 billion  and incurred approximately $2.1 billion  in costs over the three-year period 2017-2019. Savings of approximately 
$500 million  were reinvested in our R&D pipeline and in selling and marketing to support our current and recently launched products and indications.
Transforming to a More Focused Company
With the formation of the GSK Consumer Healthcare venture and the pending combination of Upjohn with Mylan, P
fizer is transforming itself into a more focused, global leaderin science-based innovative medicines. As a result, we began, in the fourth quarter of 2019, to
 identify and undertake efforts to ensure our cost base aligns appropriately withour Biopharmaceutical revenue base, which is expected to be 20% less (based on the midpoint of the range for 2020 New P
fizer revenue guidance (see the “Our FinancialGuidance for 2020” section of this Financial Review), compared to 2019 total company reported revenue) as a result of both the completed Consumer Healthcare and expected
Upjohn transactions. While certain direct costs have transferred or will transfer to the Consumer Healthcare joint venture and to the Upjohn entities, there are indirect costs
which are not expected to transfer. In addition, we are taking steps 
to restructure our organizations to appropriately support and drive the purpose of the three core functions ofour focused innovative medicines business: R&D, Manufacturing and Commercial. 
We expect the costs associated with this multi-year effort to continue through 2022  and tototal approximately 
$1.4 billion  on a pre-tax basis and approximately 10%  of this to be non-cash. Actions may include, among others, changes in location of certain activities,expanded use and co-location of centers of excellence and shared services, and increased use of digital technologies. The associated actions and
 the specific costs arecurrently in development but will include severance and benefit plan impacts, exit costs as well as associated implementation costs.
We expect net cost savings of about 
$1.0 billion  to be achieved over the three-year period 2020-2022. Certain qualifying costs associated with this program were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 and are reflected as Certain Significant Items and excluded 
from our non-GAAP measure of Adjusted Income. See the “Non-GAAP FinancialMeasure (Adjusted Income)” section of this Financial Review for additional information. These savings are expected to be realized primarily in procurement and in enabling
functions (as described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––
Note 17A. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information : Segment Information). For additional information about this program and expected and actual total costs, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—
Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives
. In addition to these major initiatives, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of the losses of exclusivity
and the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products.

•
tax benefits related to the TCJA, including certain 2018 tax initiatives as well as favorable adjustments to the provisional estimate of the impact of the legislation, reportedand disclosed within the applicable measurement period, in accordance with guidance issued by the SEC;
•
the favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business; as well as•
an increase in tax benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration ofcertain statutes of limitations.
For details about discrete elements that impacted our tax provisions, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—
Note 5A. Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations
. Changes in Tax Laws
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted significant changes to
 U.S. tax law following the passage and signing of the TCJA. The TCJA is complex and significantly changesthe U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, reducing the U.
S. Federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, transitioning U.S. international taxation from aworldwide tax system to a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated accumulated post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
 In accordance with guidance issued by the SEC we recorded provisional estimates of the legislation in the fourth-quarter 2017. In 2018, we finalized our provisional accounting for the tax
effects of the TCJA based on our best es
timates of available information and data, and have reported and disclosed the impacts within the applicable measurement period, inaccordance with guidance issued by the SEC. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—
Note 5A. Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations 
and the “Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources––Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations” section of this Financial Review.
On January 23, 2017, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed into law Act
 No. 3-2017, amending Section 2101 of the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 1994, which imposesan excise tax that was effective beginning in 2011 (Act 154). The excise 
tax is imposed on the purchase of products by multinational corporations and their affiliates from theirPuerto Rico affiliates. As originally adopted, the excise tax was to be in effec
t from 2011 through 2016 and the tax rate was to decline over time from 4% in 2011 to 1% in 2016.Act No. 2-2013 extended the excise tax through 2017 and,
 effective July 1, 2013, increased the tax rate to 4% for all years through 2017. Act No. 3-2017 further extended theexcise tax for all years through 2027 at a rate of 4%. The excise 
tax has been recorded in Cost of sales  and  Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income, as appropriate. All expected impacts in 
2020  have been reflected in our financial guidance for 2020 . NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE (ADJUSTED INCOME)
General Description of Non-GA
AP Financial Measure (Adjusted Income)Adjusted income is an alternative view of performance used by management. We measure the performance of the overall Company on this basis in conjunction with other
performance metrics. Because Adjusted income is an important internal measurement for Pfizer, we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by
disclosing this performance measure. We report Adjusted income, certain components of Adjusted income, and Adjusted diluted earnings per share in order to portray the
results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of prescription medicines and vaccines––prior to considering certain income
statement elements. We have defined Adjusted income as 
Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc.  before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items, which are described below. Similarly, we have defined the Adjusted income components as 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses, Research and development expenses, Amortization of intangible assets 
and  Other (income)/deductions––net each before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. We have defined Adjusted diluted earnings per share as 
Earnings per common share attributable to Pfizer Inc.––diluted
 before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certainsignificant items. The Adjusted income measure, the Adjusted income component measures and the Adjusted diluted earnings per share measure are not, and should no
t beviewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP ne
t income, U.S. GAAP net income components or U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share.The following are examples of how the Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share measures are utilized:
•
senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share basis;•
our annual budgets are prepared on an Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share basis; and•
senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share measures. The bonus plans for virtually allbonus-eligible, non-sales-force employees worldwide, including the Executive Leadership Team members
34
 
 2019 Financial Report
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
and other members of senior management, are funded from a pool based on the performance measured by three financial metrics, including Adjusted diluted earnings per
share, which is derived from Adjusted income. This metric accounts for 40% of the bonus pool funding. In addition,
 effective in 2019, Adjusted net income, which is derivedfrom Adjusted income, is one of the measures utilized to determine payout for PSAs and
 is used for performance years starting in 2019, except for the 2017 PSA grant thatused the previous metric, Adjusted operating income.
Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures that have no s
tandardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAPand, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, Adjusted income and its components
 (unlike U.S. GAAP net incomeand its components) and Adjusted diluted earnings per share (unlike U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share) may not be comparable to the calculation of
 similar measures ofother companies. Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted earnings per share are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how
management assesses performance.
We also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, the Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted
 diluted earnings per share measures have limitations,and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these metrics. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without
including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not
 provide a comparable view of our performance toother companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. We also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&D
organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on
 an absolute basis and relative to a publicly tradedpharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of Pfizer’s long-term incentive compensation plans.
See the accompanying reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAAP adjusted
 information for 2019 , 2018 and 2017  below. Purchase Accounting Adjustments
Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. These
impacts, primarily associated with Wyeth (acquired in 2009), Hospira (acquired in 2015), Anacor (acquired in 2016) and Medivation (acquired in 2016), can include the
incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to 
fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, and to a much lesser extent, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the
 acquired fixed assets (primarily manufacturing facilities),amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes associated with contingent consideration. Therefore,
 the Adjusted incomemeasure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.
Certain of the purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years, but this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance tha
t is used bymanagement to internally assess business performance. We believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and
investors an alternative view of our business results by trying to provide a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which R&D costs previously have been
expensed.
However, a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through Adjusted income. This
component of Adjusted income is derived solely from the impacts of the items listed in the first paragraph of this sec
tion. We have not factored in the impacts of any otherdifferences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does no
t intend to berepresentative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. For example, our R&D costs in total, and
 in the periods presented, may have been different; ourspeed to commercialization and resulting sales, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been
 different. In addition, our marketing efforts mayhave been received differently by our customers. As such, in total, there can be
 no assurance that our Adjusted income amounts would have been the same as presented hadwe discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.
Acquisition-Related Costs
Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs associated with business combinations
because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs tha
t were incurred to restructure and integrate two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision.For additional clarity, only transaction costs, additional depreciation and restructuring and integration activities that are associated with a business combination or a net-asset
acquisition are included in acquisition-related costs. We have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.
We believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in connection
with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities.
For this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the con
text of abusiness combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts.
The integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts typically ending within three
years of the transaction. Because of the need 
for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activitiescan be lengthy. For example, due to the highly regulated nature of the pharmaceutical business, the
 closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturingchanges are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the FDA
 and/or other global regulatory authorities.2019 Financial Report

Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
Discontinued Operations
Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such
operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our businesses and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do
not build or run our businesses with the intent to sell them. Restatements due to discontinued operations do
 not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measurefor the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented 
for consistency across all periods.Certain Significant Items
Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. Certain significant items represent substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated on an
individual basis. Such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspects of their nature.
 Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult topredict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs
stand on their own as they are specific to an event or goal with a defined 
term, but we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, costproductivity or in response to loss of exclusivity or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances
specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the
 date of acquisition.Unusual items may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a
 result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of ournormal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. While not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be
included as certain significant items would be gains on the completion of joint venture transactions such as the gain on the completion of
 the Consumer Healthcare jointventure transaction discussed in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—
Note 2C. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, Licensing Arrangements and Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements
: Equity-Method Investment and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale , a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs; amounts related to certain disposals of businesses, products or facilities that do not
qualify as discontinued operations under U.S. GAAP; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the
 resolution of certain tax positions; the impact of adoptingcertain significant, event-driven tax legislation, such as the TCJA discussed in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—
Note 5A. Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations
 or charges related to certain legal matters, such as certain of those discussed in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 16A. Contingencies and Certain Commitments
: Legal Proceedings and in Part II, Item 1, “Legal Proceedings” in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Normal, ongoing defense costs o f theCompany or settlements of and accruals for legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items.
Beginning in 2019, we exclude the gains and losses from equity securities from our measure of Adjusted income because of their inherent volatility, which we do not control
and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe that including these gains and
 losses assists investors in understanding our business or isreflective of our core operations and business. For example, in 2018, we contributed assets related to our allogeneic CAR T therapy to 
Allogene and received equity securities.We have revised Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted EPS for prior periods for consistency with our 2019 presentation.

 The effective tax rate on Non-GAAP Adjusted income was 15.0%  in 2019, 15.4% in 2018 and 19.9%  in 2017. The decrease in the effective tax r ate on Non-GAAP Adjusted income for 2019, compared with 2018,was primarily due to a favorable c
hange in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business, partially offset by a decrease in tax benefits associated with theresolution of certain tax positio
ns pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities. The decrease in the effective tax rate on Non-GAAP Adjusted income for 2018 compared with 2017 wasprimarily due to tax benefits associ
ated with the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course ofbusiness, as well as an increase i
n benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration of certain statutes oflimitations.

he GPD organization for possible clinical and commercial development. R&D spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. The WRDMorganization also has resp
onsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide end-to-end technical expertise and other services to the various R&D projects, as well asthe Worldwide Medical and Safety 
group, which ensures that Pfizer provides all stakeholders––including patients, healthcare providers, pharmacists, payers and health authorities––with complete and up-to-date information on the risks a

(ii)
 GPD––the costs associated with our GPD organization, which is generally responsible for clinical trials from WRDM in the Biopharma portfolio, including late stage portfolio spend. GPD also provides technicalsupport and other services to Pfiz
er R&D projects. GPD is responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies.(iii)
 Other—the operating results of our Consumer Healthcare business, through July 31, 2019, and costs associated with other commercial activities not managed as part of Biopharma or Upjohn, including allstrategy, business deve

ocurement), patient advocacy activities and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments, as wellas overhead expenses ass
ociated with our manufacturing (which include manufacturing variances associated with production) and commercial operations that are not directly assessed to an operatingsegment, as business uni
t (segment) management does not manage these costs.We recognized the follo
wing amounts in Cost of sales  related to forward-ex change contracts designated as cash flow hedges of a portion of our foreign exchange-denominated forecasted intercompanyinventory sales:
•
a $247 million net gain in 2019; •
a $13 million net loss in 2018; and •
a $52 million net gain in 2017. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––
Note 7F. Financial Instruments : Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities. For information purposes only, the following tables present reconciliations of the Biopharma segment operating results and Upjohn segment operating results to Biopharma and
Upjohn operating results including estimated Other costs generally associated with the Biopharma and Upjohn operating segments for 
2019 . While we do not manage our segments or have performance goals under such an allocated manner, we believe that some investors may find this information useful in their analyses.
The estimated Other costs generally associated with our operating segments do not purport to reflect the
 additional amounts that each of our operating segments would haveincurred had each segment operated as a standalone company during the period presented.
For information purposes only, for 
2019 , we estimate that Other costs attributable to our Biopharma and Upjohn segments, as described above, for combined WRDM, GPDand other business activities costs are 
$6.4 billion , and combined Corporate and Other Unallocated costs are $4.8 billion , which excludes income and costs associated with our Consumer Healthcare business. The combined Corporate and Other Unallocated costs also exclude (i) net interest-related expense not attributable to an operating segment
included in Corporate (approximately 
$1.4 billion  in Other (income)/deductions––net); and (ii) net income from investments and other assets not attributable to an operating segment included in Corporate (approximately

Revenues , 2018   $37,558  
   Operational growth/(decline):   Continued growth from certain key brands
(a)  2,495 Higher revenue from continued growth of anti-infective products in China, driven by increased demand for Sulperazon and new launches, the 2018
U.S. launches of our immune globulin intravenous products (Panzyga and Octagam) and the launches of certain anti-infectives products
(Zavicefta, Zinforo and Cresemba) in international developed and emerging markets, all in the Hospital products business
  472 Higher revenues for Inlyta, primarily in the U.S. driven by increased demand resulting from the second quarter of 2019 U.S. FDA approvals for the
combinations of certain immune checkpoint inhibitors plus Inlyta for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC
  190 Growth from Biosimilars, primarily in the U.S.
  168 Higher revenues for rare disease products driven by the U.S. launches in May 2019 of Vyndaqel and in September 2019 of 
Vyndamax, for thetreatment of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM); and in international markets, primarily driven by continued uptake for the
transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy indication, primarily in developed Europe, as well as the March 2019 launch of the ATTR-CM indication in
Japan, partially offset by lower revenues for certain rare disease products, including the hemophilia franchises (Refacto AF/Xyntha and BeneFIX),
primarily due to competitive pressures, and Genotropin in developed markets, mainly due to unfavorable channel mix in the U.S.
  159 Lower revenues from other Hospital products, primarily reflecting declines in developed markets, mostly due to the continued expected negative
impact from generic competition for products that have previously lost marketing exclusivity

Costs and Expenses
•
Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues  was relatively flat.•
The increase in Cost of sales of 6% was mainly driven by an unfavorable change in product mix, an increase in royalty expenses based on the mix of products sold, and anincrease in sales volumes for various products within our product portfolio, partially offset by a favorable impact of foreign exchange.
•
The increase in Selling, informational and administrative expenses of 5% was mostly driven by additional investment in emerging markets, the Oncology portfolio indeveloped markets, and for marketing and promotional expenses associated with the U.S. launches of Vyndaqel in May 2019 and 
Vyndamax in September 2019, as well asan increase in healthcare reform expenses, partially offset by a favorable impact of foreign exchange.
•
The increase in Research and development expenses of 15% was mainly related to the Array acquisition, as well as an increase in medical spend for new and growingproducts.
•
The unfavorable change in Other (income)/deductions––net primarily reflects a $246 million  decrease in income from collaborations, out-licensing arrangements and sales of compound/product rights and a 
$33 million  decrease in dividend income from our investment in ViiV, partially offset by an increase in royalty-related income mainly due to a one-time favorable resolution in the second quarter of 2019 of a legal dispute for 
$82 million , as well as a favorable impact of foreign exchange. 2018

reduction and productivity initiatives.
•
The increase in Research and development expenses of 7% was driven by an increase in medical spend, mostly in Oncology (including Ibrance, as well as investments fornew global capabilities) and expenses associated with the creation of new business units, as well as support for recently launched assets (including Talzenna), partially

Operating Activities
2019
 v. 2018Our net cash provided by operating activities was 
$12.6 billion  in 2019, compared to $15.8 billion  in 2018. The decrease  in net cash provided by operating activities reflects the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors in the ordinary course of business, the upfront cash payment
 associated with our acquisition of Therachon, and theupfront cash payment associated with our licensing agreement with Akcea (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
––Note 2A. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity- Method Investments and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, Licensing Arrangements and Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements

increase  in net income and a decrease in benefit plan contributions. In 
2019, the change in the line item Other adjustments, net  primarily reflects, among other items: •
the non-recurrence of a non-cash gain associated with our transaction with Bain Capital to create a new biopharmaceutical company, Cerevel, to continue development of aportfolio of clinical and pre-clinical stage neuroscience assets in 2018 (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
–– Note 2A . Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-MethodInvestments and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, Licensing Arrangements and Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements

•
net gains on foreign exchange contracts hedging a portion of our forecasted intercompany inventory sales (that fixes the cost of inventory sold later to customers).In 
2019 and 2018 , the line item Other changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures,  primarily reflects changes, in the normal course of business, in trade accounts receivable, inventories, other current assets, other noncurrent assets, trade accounts payable, accrued compensation,
 other current and noncurrent liabilities, as wellas in 2019, the adjustment necessary to reflect the non-cash nature of
 a favorable settlement of a U.S. IRS audit for multiple tax years (see Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements

 v. 2017Our net cash provided by operating activities was 
$15.8 billion  in 2018, compared to $16.8 billion  in 2017. The decrease  in net cash provided by operating activities reflects a decrease in net cash generated from net income. The net cash generated reflects the
 timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors in the ordinary course ofbusiness.
In 
2018, the change in the line item Other adjustments, net  primarily reflects, among other items: •
the non-recurrence of a non-cash net loss on early retirement of debt under an exchange offer in 2017;•
unrealized net gains on equity securities resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard on January 1, 2018, related to the recognition and measurement offinancial assets and liabilities;
•
a decrease in debt extinguishment costs in 2018 related to early retirement of debt under an exchange offer in 2017, which had been reclassified from operating to financingactivities in 2018 and 2017 in accordance with our implementation of a new accounting standard on January 1, 2018 related to the
 classification of debt prepayment andextinguishment costs;

 other current and noncurrent liabilities.Investing Activities
2019
 v. 2018Our net cash used in investing activities was 
$3.9 billion  in 2019, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $4.5 billion  in 2018. The change in net cash used in/provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to:
•
cash used for the acquisition of Array, net of cash acquired, of $10.9 billion  in 2019, partially offset by:
•
an increase in net proceeds generated from the sale of investments of $2.9 billion  for cash needs, including financing the acquisition of Array (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
–– Note 2A. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, Licensing Arrangements and Research andDevelopment and Collaborative Arrangements: Acquisitions

$4.5 billion  in 2018, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $4.7 billion  in 2017. The change in net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities was primarily attributable to:
•
an increase in net proceeds generated from the sale of investments of $8.6 billion  in 2018 for cash needs; and •
a decrease in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $1.0 billion  due to the acquisition of the development and commercialization rights to AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business and substantially all of the remaining consideration for the Medivation acquisition in 
2017  (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements —

) .Financing Activities
2019
 v. 2018Our net cash used in financing activities was 
$8.5 billion  in 2019, compared to $20.4 billion  in 2018. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to:
•
$10.6 billion net proceeds raised from short-term borrowings in 2019 , primarily in connection with the acquisition of Array, compared to net payments on short-termborrowings of 
$2.3 billion  in 2018; and •
lower purchases of common stock of $3.3 billion , partially offset by:
•
higher repayments on long-term debt of $3.2 billion ; and •
lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $864 million . 2018
 v. 2017Our net cash used in financing activities was 
$20.4 billion  in 2018, compared to $13.3 billion  in 2017. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to:
•
$2.3 billion less proceeds raised from short-term borrowings in 2018 , compared to 2017 ; and •
higher purchases of common stock of $7.2 billion , partially offset by:
•
lower repayments on long-term debt of $2.6 billion . ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We rely largely on operating cash flows, short-term investments, short-term commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for our liquidity requirements. We
continue our efforts to improve cash inflows through working capital efficiencies. We target specific areas of focus including accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable,
and other working capital, which allows us to optimize our operating cash flows.
2019 Financial Report

Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
Due to our significant operating cash flows as well as our financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we believe
that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, which include:
•
the working capital requirements of our operations, including our R&D activities;•
investments in our business;•
dividend payments and potential increases in the dividend rate;•
share repurchases;•
the cash requirements associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;•
paying down outstanding debt;•
contributions to our pension and postretirement plans; and•
business-development activities.Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both S&P and Moody’s. See the “Credit Ratings” section below. As market conditions change,
 we continue to monitor our liquidityposition. We have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. Bo
th short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified available-for-sale debt securities.

Financial Statements–– Note 2A. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, Licensing Arrangements and Research and Developmentand Collaborative Arrangemen
ts: Acquisitions). We retain a strong financial liqui dity position as a result of our net cash provided by operating activities, our high-quality financial asset portfolio and access tocapital markets. For additional inform
ation, see the “Credit Ratings” section of this Financial Review.(c)
 The decrease in working capital was primarily due to:•
financing requirements for the acquisition of Array, share repurchase activities, dividend payments, capital expenditures and debt repayment, partially offset by operating cash flow generation, cash fromemployee stock option exe
rcises and the March 2019 long-term debt issuance discussed below;•
the impact of the deconsolidation of the Consumer Healthcare business as a result of the completion of the joint venture transaction; and•
the net impact of foreign currency exchange,partially offset by:
•
the timing of accruals, cash receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business; and•
an increase in inventory for certain products, including inventory build for new product launches, supply recovery, and market demand, partially offset by a charge related to rivipansel, primarily for inventorymanufactured for expected f
uture sale (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2E. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method I nvestments and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, LicensingArrangements and Research and
 Development and Collaborative Arrangements: Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements for additional information).(d)
 Represents total Pfizer Inc. shareholders’ equity divided by the actual number of common shares outstanding (which excludes treasury stock).On February 11, 2020, we issued a notice for the redemption in full of all 
$1.065 billion  principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2047. The notes will be redeemed on March 17, 2020 at par as set forth in the indenture agreement. We do
 not expect this redemption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.In March 2019, we completed a public offering of 
$5.0 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a weighted average effective interest rate of 3.57% (see 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 7D. Financial Instruments : Long-Term Debt). For additional information about the sources and uses of our funds, see the

Domestic and Internatio
nal Selected Financial AssetsMany of our operations are conducted outside the U.S., and significant portions of
 our selected financial assets are held internationally. The amount of funds held in U.S. taxjurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due 
to other reasons, such as business-development activities. Aspart of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). The changes in tax law under the
TCJA, which includes transitioning U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, will also allow us to more easily access our selected
financial assets globally. The majority of our cash we held internationally as of year-end 2017 was repatriated in 2018.
Agreement to Combine Upjo
hn with MylanIn connection with the recently-announced agreement to combine Upjohn with Mylan discussed in the “Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and
Outlook––Our Business Development Initiatives” section of this Financial Review, Upjohn will incur approximately $12 billion of debt prior to the closing of the transaction.
Immediately prior to the separation, Upjohn will make a cash distribution of $12 billion to Pfizer, which will be funded by the proceeds of such debt. Following the separation,
Upjohn will remain the obligor with respect to the debt.
Credit Ratings
Two major corporate debt-rating organizations, Moody’s and S&P, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or
hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any o
ther rating.In June 2019, S&P placed Pfizer on “CreditWatch Negative” following the announcement of P
fizer’s intention to acquire Array. The CreditWatch placement was resolved with aone-notch downgrade of Pfizer’s debt rating to ‘AA-’ upon the consummation of the transaction.
 In July 2019, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement tocombine Upjohn with Mylan, which resulted in actions from both Moody’s and S&P. Moody’s placed Pfizer’s long-term rating under review for downgrade (limited to one-notch,
or ‘A2’ upon close of the Mylan transaction) while S&P lowered Pfizer’s rating to ‘AA-’ (as a result of the Array transaction) and confirmed it will still remain on CreditWatch
Negative (with the expectation the rating will be lowered one additional notch to ‘A+’ upon close of the Mylan transaction).
The following table provides the current ratings assigned by these rating agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured long-term debt:

ditWe have available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries. We typically maintain cash and cash equivalent
balances and short-term investments which, together with our available revolving credit facilities, are in excess of our commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. As of
December 31, 2019
, we had access to a total of $15 billion  in U.S. revolving credit facilities consisting of a $7 billion  facility expiring in 2024 and an $8 billion  facility expiring in September 2020, which may be used to support our commercial paper borrowings. In addition to the U.S. revolving credit facilities, our lenders have provided us an additional
$537 million
 in lines of credit, of which $508 million  expire within one year. Of these total lines of credit, $15.5 billion  were unused on December 31, 2019 . In connection with the recently-announced agreement to combine Upjohn with Mylan discussed in the “Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook––Our
Business Development Initiatives” section of this Financial Review, Upjohn entered into a fully underwritten, 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility for up to $12 billion. This
bridge facility is expected to terminate upon the issuance of approximately $12 billion of debt securities, loans or a combination of the two by
 Upjohn prior to the transactionclose.
LIBOR
From time to time, we issue variable rate debt based on LIBOR, or undertake interest rate swaps tha
t contain a variable element based on LIBOR. The U.K. Financial ConductAuthority announced in July 2017 that it will no longer compel banks to submit rates that are currently used to calculate L
IBOR after 2021. Various governing parties, includinggovernment agencies, are working on a benchmark transition plan for LIBOR (and other interbank offered rates globally). We are monitoring their progress, and we will likely
amend contracts to accommodate any replacement rate where it is not already provided. We do not expect the
 transition to an alternative rate to have a material impact on ourliquidity or financial resources.
Global Economic Conditions––Ge
neralThe global economic environment has not had, nor do we anticipate it will have, a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Due to our significant operating cash
flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and
 will maintain, the abilityto meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We monitor our liquidity position continuously in the face of evolving economic conditions.

 Includes expected payments relating to our unfunded U.S. supplemental (non-qualified) pension plans, postretirement plans and deferred compensation plans. Excludes amounts relating to our U.S. qualifiedpension plans and international
 pension plans, all of which have a substantial amount of plan assets, because the required funding obligations are not expected to be material and/or because such liabilities do notnecessarily reflect future cash paym
ents, as the impact of changes in economic conditions on the fair value of the pension plan assets and/or liabilities can be significant. Also, excludes $3.9 billion  of liabilities related to the fair value of d
erivative financial instruments, legal matters and employee terminations, among other liabilities, most of which do not represent contractual obligations. See also our liquidity discussionabove in this “Analysis of Financial Co
ndition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” section, as well as the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 3. Restructuring Charges a nd Other Costs Associatedwith Acquisitions and Cost-Reductio

and Note 16. Contingencies and Certain Commitments. (d)
 Includes future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. These amounts include an agreement we entered in April 2018 to lease space in an office building in New York City. Weexpect to take control of the pr
operty in 2021 and relocate our global headquarters to this new office building in 2022. Our future minimum rental commitment under this 20-year lease is approximately $1.7 billion . (e)
 Includes agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and includes amounts relating to advertising, information technology services, employee benefit administrationservices, and potential mileston
e payments deemed reasonably likely to occur. Also includes obligations to make guaranteed fixed annual payments over the next 7 years in connection with the U.S. and EUapprovals for Besponsa (
$412 million ) and an obligation to make  guaranteed fixed annual payments over the next 8 years for Bosulif ($217 million ), both associated with R&D arrang ements. For additionalinformation, see Notes to Consoli

on, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5A. Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Co ntinuing Operations and Note 5C. Tax Matters: Deferred Taxes. (g)
 Includes only income tax amounts currently payable. We are unable to predict the timing of tax settlements related to our noncurrent obligations for uncertain tax positions as tax audits can involve complex issuesand the resolution of thos
e issues may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation.The above table includes amounts for potential milestone payments under collaboration, licensing or other arrangements, if the payments are deemed reasonably likely to
occur. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and/or commercialization
milestones, which may span several years and which may never occur.
In 
2020, we expect to spend approximately $2.4 billion  on property, plant and equipment. We rely largely on operating cash flows to fund our capital investment needs. Due toour significant operating cash flows, we believe we have the ability to meet our capital investment needs and anticipate no delays to planned capital expenditures.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and
 other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certainliabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If 
the indemnified party were to make asuccessful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnification obligations generally are subject to various
restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of 
December 31, 2019 , the estimated fair value of our indemnification obligations was not significant.
Certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-
promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products.

We paid dividends on our common stock of 
$8.0 billion  in 2019, $8.0 billion in 2018 and $7.7 billion  in 2017. In December 2019 , our Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2020 dividend of 
$0.38  per share, payable on March 6, 2020 , to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 31, 2020 . The first-quarter 2020  cash dividend will be our 325
th consecutive quarterly dividend.Our current and projected dividends provide a return to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital to invest in growing our businesses. Our dividends are not restricted by
debt covenants. While the dividend level remains a decision of Pfizer’s Board of Directors and will continue to be evaluated in the context o
f future business performance, wecurrently believe that we can support future annual dividend increases, barring significant unforeseen events. Pfizer also expects that immediately following the closing of the
proposed transaction to combine Upjohn with Mylan, the combined dividend dollar amount received by Pfizer shareholders in the event the equity distribution is structured as a
spinoff, based upon the combination of continued Pfizer ownership and an expected 0.12
 shares of the new company granted for each Pfizer share, will equate to Pfizer’sdividend amount in effect immediately prior to closing.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—
Note 1B. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards in 2019 . Recently Issued Accounting Standards, Not 
Adopted as of December 31, 2019Standard/Description
  Effective Date   Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant MattersIn June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting 
forcredit losses of financial instruments
. The new guidance and related amendments replace the probable initial recognition
threshold for incurred loss estimates in current GAAP with a
methodology that reflects expected credit loss estimates.
 
January 1, 2020. 
This standard includes our financial instruments, such as accountsreceivable, and investments that are generally of high credit quality.
Previously, when credit losses were measured under GAAP, an entity
generally only considered past events and current conditions in
measuring the incurred loss.
The new guidance requires us to identify, analyze, document and
support new methodologies for quantifying expected credit loss
estimates for our financial instruments, using information such as
historical experience and current economic conditions, plus the use of
reasonable supportable forecast information. We do not expect this
new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance for 
goodwill impairment testing
. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to
measure goodwill impairment. Under the new guidance the
goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value
of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and recognizing an
impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount
of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, although it cannot
exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting
unit.
  January 1, 2020. 
We do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on ourconsolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance related 
tocustomers’ accounting for implementation costs incurred in
a cloud computing arrangement that is considered a service
contract
. The new guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs in such arrangements with the
requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to
develop or obtain internal-use software. The new guidance can
be adopted either prospectively or retrospectively.
  January 1, 2020. 
We do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on ourconsolidated financial statements.
In November 2018, the FASB issued new guidance clarifying the
interaction between the accounting guidance for 
collaboration agreements 
and  revenue from contracts with customers.  January 1, 2020. 
We do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on ourconsolidated financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance that simplifies
the 
accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions to the guidance related to the approach for intraperiod
tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an
interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for
outside basis differences. The new guidance also simplifies
aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted
changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for
transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill.
  January 1, 2021. Early adoptionis permitted.
 
We are assessing the impact of the provisions of this new guidance onour consolidated financial statements.

the outcome of R&D activities, including, without limitation, the ability to meet anticipated pre-clinical or clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for ourpre-clinical or clinical trials, regulatory submission dates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates, as well as the possibility of unfavorable pre-clinical and clinical trial
results, including the possibility of unfavorable new clinical data and further analyses of existing clinical data;
•
the risk we may not be able to successfully address all of the comments received from regulatory authorities such as the FDA or the EMA, or obtain approval from regulators,which will depend on myriad factors, including such regulator making a determination as to whether a product’s benefits outweigh its known risks and a determination of the
product’s efficacy; regulatory decisions impacting labeling, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters; and recommendations by technical or advisory
committees, such as ACIP, that may impact the use o
f our vaccines;•
the speed with which regulatory authorizations, pricing approvals and product launches may be achieved;•
claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety or efficacy of in-line products and product candidates, including claims and concerns that may arise from theoutcome of post-approval clinical trials, which could result in the loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side
effects or efficacy of, a product that
 could affect its availability or commercial potential, such as the update to the U.S. and EU prescribing information for Xeljanz;•
the success of external business-development activities, including the ability to identify and execute on potential business development opportunities, the ability to satisfy theconditions to closing of announced transactions in the anticipated time frame or at all, the ability to realize the an
ticipated benefits of any such transactions, and the potentialneed to obtain additional equity or debt financing to pursue these opportunities, which could result in increased leverage and impact our credit ratings;

2019  Financial Report. These financial statements are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and, therefore, include amounts based on informed judgments and es
timates. We also accept responsibility for thepreparation of other financial information that is included in this document.
Report on Internal Control Ove
r Financial ReportingThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)

Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee reviews Pfizer’s financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements
and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls.
The Committee met and held discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the fair and complete presentation of Pfizer’s
results and the assessment of Pfizer’s internal control over financial reporting. We discussed significant accounting policies applied in Pfizer’s financial statements, as well as,
when applicable, alternative accounting treatments, and critical audit matters addressed during the audit. Management represented to the Committee that 
the consolidatedfinancial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the Committee reviewed and discussed
the consolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Committee discussed with the independent registered
public accounting firm matters required to be discussed under applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission standards.
In addition, the Committee reviewed and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the auditor’s independence from Pfizer and its management. As part
of that review, we received the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting
firm’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Committee discussed the independent registered public accounting firm’s independence
from Pfizer.
We also considered whether the independent registered public accounting firm’s provision of non-audit services to Pfizer is compatible with the auditor’s independence. The
Committee concluded that the independent registered public accounting firm is independent from Pfizer and its management.
As part of our responsibilities for oversight of Pfizer’s Enterprise Risk Management process, we reviewed and discussed company policies with respect to risk assessment and
risk management, including discussions of individual risk areas, as well as an annual summary of the overall process.
The Committee discussed with Pfizer’s Internal Audit Department and independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope of and plans for their respective audits.
The Committee meets with the Chief Internal Auditor, Chief Compliance, Quality and Risk Officer and representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm, in
regular and executive sessions, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of Pfizer’s internal controls, and the
 overall quality of Pfizer’s financial reporting andcompliance programs.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors, and the 
Board has approved, that the auditedfinancial statements be included in Pfizer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
2019 , for filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Committee has selected, and the Board of Directors has ratified, the selection of

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Board of Directors and 
Shareholders of Pfizer Inc.:Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pfizer Inc. and 
Subsidiary Companies (the Company) as of December 31, 2019  and 2018 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in 
the three-year period ended December 31, 2019 , and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company as of December 31, 
2019  and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each o f the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control overfinancial reporting as of December 31, 
2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated 
February 27, 2020  expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and
 are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordancewith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAO
B. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance aboutwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those
 risks. Such procedures includedexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accoun
tingprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to
be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that
 are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especiallychallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements,
taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accoun
ts or disclosuresto which they relate.
Evaluation of certain assumptions impacting the U.S. Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates accrual
As discussed in Note 1G to the consolidated financial statements, the
 Company records estimated deductions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contractrebates (collectively, U.S. rebates) as a reduction to gross product revenues. The accrual for U.S. rebates is recorded in the
 same period that the corresponding revenuesare recognized. The length of time between when a sale is made and when the U.S. rebate is paid by
 the Company can be as long as one year, which increases the needfor significant management judgment and knowledge of market conditions and practices in estimating the accrual.
We identified the evaluation of the U.S. rebates accrual as a critical audit matter because evaluating 
the product-specific experience ratio assumption underlying the estimateof
 the accrual involved especially challenging auditor judgment. The product-specific experience ratio assumption relates to estimating which of the Company’s revenuetransactions will ultimately be subject to a related rebate.
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s U.S. rebate accrual
process, including controls related to the development of the product-specific experience ratio assumptions. We recalculated the U.S. rebates accrual for a selection of
products, based on a combination of Company internal data, historical actual information, and executed third-party contracts. We performed a sensitivity analysis of 
theCompany’s accrual by recalculating the accrual using our independent assumptions. We evaluated the Company’s ability to accurately estimate the accrual for U.S. rebates
by comparing historically recorded accruals to the actual amount that was ultimately paid by the Company.
Evaluation of gross unrecognized tax benefits
As of December 31, 2019 the Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest, of 
$5.4 billion . As discussed in Notes 5D and 1P, the Company’s tax positions are subject to audit by local taxing authorities in each respective tax jurisdiction, and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Since
tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations and judgments, it is uncertain whether some of the Company’s tax positions will be sustained upon audit.
We identified the evaluation of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because complex auditor judgment is required in evaluating the
Company’s interpretation of tax law and its estimate of the ultimate resolution of its tax positions.

 2019 Financial Report
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s liability for
unrecognized tax position process, including (1) interpretation of tax law, (2) evaluation of which of the Company’s tax positions may not be sustained upon audit,
 and (3)estimation and recording of the gross unrecognized tax benefits. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge. We evaluated the
Company’s interpretation of tax laws, including the assessment of transfer pricing practices in accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations. We inspected
settlements with applicable taxing authorities, including assessing the expiration of statutes of limitations. We tested the
 calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions,including an evaluation of the Company’s assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and estimates of 
the amount of tax benefits expected to be sustained.Evaluation of product and other product-related litigation
As discussed in Notes 1R and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the
 Company is involved in product liability and other product-related litigation, which can includepersonal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others. Certain of these pending product and other product-related
legal proceedings could result in losses that could be substantial. The accrued liability and/or disclosure for the pending product and other product-related legal proceedings
requires a complex series of judgments by the Company about future events, which involves a number of uncertainties.
We identified the evaluation of the accrued liability and/or related disclosures for these legal proceedings as a critical audit matter because the nature of the
 estimates andassumptions, including judgments about uncertainties and future events, requires challenging auditor judgment.
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s product liability and
other product-related litigation processes, including (1) the evaluation of information from external and internal legal counsel, (2) forward-looking expectations, and (3) new
legal proceedings, or other legal proceedings not currently reserved or disclosed. We read letters received directly from the Company’s external and internal legal counsel
that described the Company’s probable or reasonably possible legal contingency to pending product and other product-related legal proceedings. We inspected the
Company’s minutes from meetings of the Audit Committee, which included the status of key litigation matters. We evaluated 
the Company’s ability to estimate its monetaryexposure to pending product and other product-related legal proceedings by comparing historically recorded liabilities to actual monetary amounts incurred upon resolution
of prior legal matters. We analyzed relevant publicly available information about the Company, its competitors, and the industry.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm onInternal Control Over Financial Reporting
 
The Board of Directors and Sha
reholders of Pfizer Inc.:Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control
— Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets ofPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies as of December 31, 
2019  and 2018 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 
2019 , and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 27, 2020
 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying 
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
 Commission and thePCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAO
B. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance aboutwhether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating ef
fectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
 dispositions of the assets ofthe company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
 thecompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation o
f effectiveness tofuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or proceduresmay deteriorate.

Note 1
. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting PoliciesA.
 Basis of PresentationSee the Glossary of Defined Terms at the beginning of this 
2019  Financial Report for terms used throughout the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this 2019
 Financial Report. The consolidated financial statements include our parent company and all subsidiaries, and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The decision of
 whether or not to consolidate an entity requires consideration of majority voting interests, as well as effective economicor other control over the entity. Typically, we do not seek control by means other than vo
ting interests. For subsidiaries operating outside the U.S., the financial information isincluded as of and for the year ended November 30 for each year presented. Pfizer's fiscal year-end for U.S.
 subsidiaries is as of and for the year ended December 31 for eachyear presented. Substantially all unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries are free of legal and contractual restrictions. All significant transactions among our businesses
have been eliminated. Beginning on January 1, 2018, only taxes paid on intercompany inventory sales transactions are deferred until recognized upon the sale of 
the inventoryto a third party, reflecting the adoption of a new accounting standard in 
the first quarter of 2018. Prior to the adoption of this new accounting standard in the first quarter of2018, taxes paid on intercompany sales transactions were deferred until recognized upon sale of the asset to a 
third party.From the second quarter of our 2016 fiscal year until the end of 2018, we managed our commercial operations through 
two  distinct business segments: Pfizer InnovativeHealth (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH). At the beginning of our 2019 fiscal year, we began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure
consisting of 
three  business segments––Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group (Biopharma), Upjohn and through July 31, 2019 , Consumer Healthcare. Biopharma and Upjohn are the only reportable segments. We have revised prior-period segment information to reflect the reorganization. For additional information, see 
Note 17 . In addition, certain amounts within 
Long-term investments  in the December 31, 2018 consolidated balance sheet have been reclassified to Equity-method investments  to conform to the current presentation. For additional information, see 
Note 2C. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements and associated notes may not add due to
 rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts.In the first quarter of 2019, as of January 1,
 2019, we adopted four  new accounting standards. See Note 1B  for further information. Our recent significant business development activities include:
•
License Agreement with Akcea Therapeutics, Inc.–– In October 2019, we entered into a worldwide exclusive licensing agreement for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, aninvestigational antisense therapy being developed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, with Akcea, a majority-owned affiliate of Ionis. The
transaction closed in November 2019 and we made an upfront payment of
 $250 million to Akcea and Ionis, which was recorded in Research and development expenses in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2019.
•
Formation of a New Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture––On July 31, 2019 , we completed the transaction in which we and GSK combined our respective consumerhealthcare businesses into a new consumer healthcare joint venture that operates globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name.
 In accordance with our domestic andinternational reporting periods, our financial results, and our Consumer Healthcare segment’s operating results, for 2019 reflect seven months of Consumer Healthcare
segment domestic operations and eight months of Consumer Healthcare segment international operations. Assets and liabilities associated with our Consumer Healthcare
business were reclassified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.
•
Acquisition of Array BioPharma Inc.––On July 30, 2019 , we acquired Array for $48  per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred for Array wasapproximately 
$11.2 billion  ( $10.9 billion, net of cash acquired). Our financial statements for 2019 reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Array, commencing from the acquisition date
. •
Agreement to Combine Upjohn with Mylan N.V.–– On July 29, 2019, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to combine Upjohn with Mylan, creating anew global pharmaceutical company, Viatris. Under the terms of the agreement, which is structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction, Upjohn is expected to
be spun off or split off to Pfizer’s shareholders and, immediately thereafter, combined with Mylan.
 Pfizer shareholders would own 57%  of the combined new company, andformer Mylan shareholders would own 
43% . Closing of the transaction is subject to Mylan shareholder approval and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions,including receipt of regulatory approvals.
•
Acquisition of Therachon Holding AG––On July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon for $340 million  upfront, plus potential milestone payments of up to 
$470 million, contingent on the achievement of key milestones in the development and commercialization of the lead asset. The total fair value of the considerationtransferred for Therachon was approximately
 $322 million. Our financial statements for 2019 reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Therachon,commencing from the acquisition date and, in accordance with our international reporting period, reflect five months of Therachon operations and cash flows.
•
Sale of Hospira Infusion Systems Net Assets to ICU Medical, Inc.––On February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our global infusion systems net assets,  HIS, to ICUMedical for up to approximately 
$900 million , composed of cash and contingent cash consideration, ICU Medical common stock (all of which we sold during 2018) and seller financing. HIS includes IV pumps, solutions and devices. The operating results of HIS are included in our consolidated sta
tement of income through February 2, 2017 and,therefore, our financial results for 2017 reflect one month of HIS domestic operations and two months o
f HIS international operations. Our financial results for 2019  and 2018 do not reflect any contribution from HIS global operations.

•
Acquisition of AstraZeneca’s Small Molecule Anti-Infectives Business––On December 22, 2016, which fell in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 for our international operations, we acquired the development and commercialization rights to AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business, primarily outside the U.S. for approximately 
$1.0 billion
, composed of cash and contingent consideration. Our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of this business, commencing from the acquisition date and, in accordance with our international reporting period, for 2017 reflect approximately 11 months of the small molecule anti-
infectives business operations and cash flows acquired from AstraZeneca.
For additional information, see 
Note 2 . B.
 Adoption of New Accounting Standards in 2019On January 1, 2019, we adopted 
four  new accounting standards.Leases
––On January 1, 2019, we adopted a new accounting standard for leases and changed  our lease policies accordingly. Under the new standard, the most significantchange is the requirement of balance sheet recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. We adopted 
the newaccounting standard utilizing the modified retrospective method using a simplified transition approach, and, therefore, no adjustments were made to our prior period financial
statements. We have elected the package of practical expedients for 
transition which are permitted in the new standard. Accordingly, we did not reassess whether (i) anyexpired or existing contracts are or contain leases under the new standard, (ii) classification of leases as operating leases or capital leases would be different under the new
standard, or (iii) any initial direct costs would have met the definition of initial direct costs under the new standard. Additionally, we did not elect to use
 hindsight in determiningthe lease term for existing leases as of January 1, 2019. We recorded noncurrent ROU assets of 
$1.4 billion  and current and noncurrent operating lease liabilities of $1.4 billion as of January 1, 2019. We also recorded the cumulative effect of
 adopting the standard as an adjustment to increase the opening balance of Retained earnings  by $30 millionon a pre-tax basis (
$20 million  after-tax), relating to previously deferred sale-leaseback gains that can be recognized under the new rules. Adopting the standard related to leases impacted our prior period consolidated balance sheet as follows:

  89,554  20  89,574 Adoption of the standard related to leases did not have a material impact on our consolidated sta
tements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows in 2019 . For additional information, see 
Note 1T . Amortization Period for Certain Callable Debt Securities Held at a Premium
––We prospectively adopted the standard, which shortens the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium. The new guidance requires the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. We do not have any investments with fea
turessubject to this standard and, therefore, there was no impact to our consolidated 
financial statements from the adoption of this new standard.Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity and Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features
––We prospectively adopted the standard, which changes the accounting for warrants or convertible instruments that include a down round feature. We
 do not have any financialinstruments with features subject to this standard and, therefore, there was no impact 
to our consolidated financial statements from the adoption of this new standard.Accounting for Share-Based Payments to Nonemployees
––We prospectively adopted the standard, which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees by aligning it with the accounting for share-based payments to employees, with certain exceptions. Under the guidance, the measurement of equity-classified
nonemployee awards will be fixed at the grant date. We do not have any share-based awards issued to nonemployees and, therefore,
 there was no impact to our consolidatedfinancial statements from the adoption of this new standard.
C. Estimates and Assumptions
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions that affec
t reported amounts and disclosures, including amounts recorded anddisclosed in connection with acquisitions. These estimates and underlying assumptions can impact all elements of our financial statements. For example, in the consolidated
statements of income, estimates are used when accounting for deductions from revenues (such as rebates, chargebacks,
 sales allowances and sales returns), determining thecost of inventory that is sold, allocating cost in the form of depreciation and amortization, and
 estimating restructuring charges and the impact of contingencies, as well asdetermining provisions for taxes on income. On the consolidated balance sheets, estimates are used in determining the valuation and recoverability of assets, such as
accounts receivable, investments, inventories, deferred tax assets, fixed assets and intangible assets (including acquired IPR&D assets), and
 estimates are used indetermining the reported amounts of liabilities, such as taxes payable, benefit obligations, accruals for contingencies, rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales
returns, and restructuring reserves, all of which also impact the consolidated statements of income.

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
Our estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but
 that can be inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If ourestimates and assumptions are not representative of actual outcomes, our results could be materially impacted.
As future events and their effects cannot be
 determined with precision, our estimates and assumptions may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, or unanticipated events andcircumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. We are subject
 to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differfrom estimated amounts, such as changes in the healthcare environment, competition, litigation, legislation and regulations. We regularly evaluate our estimates and
assumptions using historical experience and expectations about the future. We adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts
 and circumstances indicate the need forchange.
For information on estimates and assumptions in connection with the TCJA, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––
Note 5A .  Tax Matters: Taxes on Income fromContinuing Operations.
D. Acquisitions
Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of acquired businesses after the completion of the acquisitions. We accoun
t for acquired businesses using theacquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of 
theacquisition date and that the fair value of acquired IPR&D be recorded on the balance shee
t. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the considerationtransferred over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. When we acquire net assets that
 do not constitute a business, as defined in U.S.GAAP, no goodwill is recognized and acquired IPR&D is expensed.
Contingent consideration in a business combination is included as part of the acquisition cost and is recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date
. Fair value is generallyestimated by using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach. See 
Note 16D . Any liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. These changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in 
Other (income)/deductions––net . Amounts recorded in connection with an acquisition can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and
assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. E. Fair Value
We are often required to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial recognition or for subsequent accounting or reporting. For example, we use fair
value extensively in the initial recognition of net assets acquired in a business combination, when measuring certain impairment losses and when accounting for and reporting
of certain financial instruments. We estimate fair value using an exit price approach, which requires, among other things, that we determine the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market. The determination of an exit price is considered from the perspective of market participants, considering the
highest and best use of non-financial assets and, for liabilities, assuming that the risk of non-performance will be the same before and af
ter the transfer.When estimating fair value, depending on the nature and complexity of the asset or liability, we may use one or all of 
the following techniques:•
Income approach, which is based on the present value of a future stream of net cash flows.•
Market approach, which is based on market prices and other information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.•
Cost approach, which is based on the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets, less an allowance for functional and/or economic obsolescence.Our fair value methodologies depend on the following types of inputs:
•
Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs).•
Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other thanquoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means
(Level 2 inputs).
•
Unobservable inputs that reflect estimates and assumptions (Level 3 inputs).A single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and
 can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. Forinformation about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. F. Foreign Currency Translation
For most of our international operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. We translate functional currency assets and liabilities to their
U.S. dollar equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the
 balance sheet date and we translate functional currency income and expense amounts to their U.S. dollarequivalents at average exchange rates for the period. The U.S. dollar effects 
that arise from changing translation rates are recorded in Other comprehensive income/(loss) . The effects of converting non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recorded in 
Other (income)/deductions––net . For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate monetary items at rates in effect as of the balance sheet da
te, with translation adjustments recorded in Other (income)/deductions–– net
, and we translate non-monetary items at historical rates.2019 Financial Report

G
. Revenues and Trade Accounts ReceivableWe recorded direct product sales and/or alliance revenues of more than 
$1 billion  for each of eight  products in 2019 , for each of ten  products in 2018  and for each of nine products in 
2017 . In the aggregate, these direct products sales and/or alliance product revenues represent 49%  of our revenues in 2019 , 51% of our revenues in 2018  and 46%
 of our revenues in 2017 . See Note 17C for additional information. The loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues as our contracts with customers will generally be at lower selling prices due to added competition and we generally provide for higher sales returns during the period
in which individual markets begin to near the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights. Our Consumer Healthcare business, which was combined with GSK’s Consumer
Healthcare business into a new consumer healthcare joint venture that operates globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name on July 31, 2019, included OTC brands
with a focus on dietary supplements, pain management, gastrointestinal and respiratory and personal care. We sell biopharmaceutical products after patent expiration, and
under patent, and, to a much lesser extent, through July 31
, 2019, we sold consumer healthcare products worldwide to developed and emerging market countries.Revenue Recognition
––We record revenues from product sales when there is a transfer of control of the product from us to  the customer. We determine transfer of controlbased on when the product is shipped or delivered and title passes to the customer.
•
Customers––Our biopharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies, and, in the case of our vaccine products in the U.S.,
 we primarily sell directly to the CDC, wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies and integrated deliverynetworks. Customers for our consumer healthcare business, which were part of the business that was combined with GSK’s Consumer Healthcare business into a new
consumer healthcare joint venture on July 31, 2019, included retailers and, to a lesser extent, wholesalers and distributors.
Biopharmaceutical products that ultimately are used by patients are generally covered under governmental programs, managed care programs and insurance programs,
including those managed through PBMs, and are subject to sales allowances and/or rebates payable directly to those programs. Those sales allowances and rebates are
generally negotiated, but government programs may have legislated amounts by type of product (e.g., patented
 or unpatented).•
Our Sales Contracts––Sales on credit are typically under short-term contracts. Collections are based on market payment cycles common in various markets, with shorter cycles in the U.S. Sales
 are adjusted for sales allowances, chargebacks, rebates and sales returns and cash discounts. Sales returns occur due to loss of exclusivity,product recalls or a changing competitive environment.
•
Deductions from Revenues––Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the
related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment is required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
Specifically:
•
In the U.S., we sell our products to distributors and hospitals under our sales contracts. However, we also have contracts with managed care or pharmacy benefit managersand legislatively mandated contracts with the federal and state governments under which we provide rebates to them based on medicines utilized by the lives they cover. We
record provisions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract pharmaceutical rebates based upon our experience ratio of rebates paid and actual prescriptions
written during prior quarters. We apply the experience ratio to the respective period’s sales to determine the rebate accrual and related expense. This experience ratio is
evaluated regularly to ensure that the historical trends are as current as practicable. We estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to Medicare Part D
participants in the Medicare “coverage gap,” also known as the “doughnut hole,” based on the historical experience of beneficiary prescriptions and consideration of the
utilization that is expected to result from the discount in the coverage gap. We
 evaluate this estimate regularly to ensure that the historical trends and future expectations areas current as practicable. For performance-based contract rebates, we also consider current contract terms, such as changes in formulary status and rebate rates.
•
Outside the U.S., the majority of our pharmaceutical sales allowances are contractual or legislatively mandated and our estimates are based on actual invoiced sales withineach period, which reduces the risk of variations in the estimation process. In certain European countries, rebates are calculated on the government’s to
tal unbudgetedpharmaceutical spending or on specific product sales thresholds and we apply an estimated allocation factor against our actual invoiced sales to project the expected level of
reimbursement. We obtain third-party information that helps us to monitor the adequacy of these accruals.
•
Provisions for pharmaceutical chargebacks (primarily reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties) closely approximate actual amountsincurred, as we settle these deductions generally within two to five weeks of incurring the liability.
•
Provisions for pharmaceutical sales returns are based on a calculation for each market that incorporates the following, as appropriate: local returns policies and practices;historical returns as a percentage of sales; an understanding of the reasons for past returns; es
timated shelf life by product; an estimate of the amount of time betweenshipment and return or lag time; and any other factors that could impact the estimate o
f future returns, such as loss of exclusivity, product recalls or a changing competitiveenvironment. Generally, returned products are destroyed, and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit.
•
We record sales incentives as a reduction of revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentive is offered, whichever is later. We estimate thecost of our sales incentives based on our historical experience with similar incentives programs to predict customer behavior.

Note 1C. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from 
Revenues . Trade Accounts Receivable
—Trade accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance against gross trade accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other
current information. Trade accounts receivable are written off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been
exhausted.
H. Collaborative Arrangements
Payments to and from our collaboration partners are presented in our consolidated statements of income based on the nature o
f the arrangement (including its contractualterms), the nature of the payments and applicable accounting guidance. Under co-promotion agreements, we record the amounts received from our collaboration partners as
alliance revenues, a component of 
Revenues,  when our collaboration partners are the principal in the transaction and we receive a share of their net sales or profits. Alliance revenues are recorded as we perform co-promotion services for the collaboration and the collaboration partners sell the products to their customers within the applicable
period. The related expenses for selling and marketing these products are included in 
Selling, informational and administrative expenses.  In collaborative arrangements where we manufacture a product for our collaboration partners, we record revenues when we transfer control of the product to our collaboration partners. In collaboration
arrangements where we are the principal in the transaction, we record amounts paid to collaboration partners for their share of net sales or profits earned, and all royalty
payments to collaboration partners as 
Cost of sales . Royalty payments received from collaboration partners are included in Other (income)/deductions—net. Reimbursements to or from our collaboration partners for development costs are recorded net in 
Research and development expenses . Upfront payments and pre-approval milestone payments due from us to our collaboration partners in development stage collaborations are recorded as 
Research and development expenses . Milestone payments due from us to our collaboration partners after regulatory approval has been attained for a medicine are recorded in 
Identifiable intangible assets—Developed technology rights
. Upfront and pre-approval milestone payments earned from our collaboration partners by us are recognized in Other (income)/deductions—net  over the development period for the collaboration products, when our performance obligations include providing R&D services to our collaboration partners. Upfront, pre-approval and post-approval
milestone payments earned by us may be recognized in 
Other (income)/deductions—net  immediately when earned or over other periods depending upon the nature of our performance obligations in the applicable collaboration. Where the milestone event is regulatory approval for a medicine, we generally recognize milestone payments due to us
in the transaction price when regulatory approval in the applicable jurisdiction has been attained. We may recognize milestone payments due to us in the transaction price
earlier than the milestone event in certain circumstances when recognition of the income would not be probable of a significant reversal.
I. Cost of Sales and Inventories
We carry inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of finished goods, work in process and raw materials is determined using average actual cost. We
regularly review our inventories for impairment and reserves are established when necessary.
J. Selling, Informational and Administ
rative ExpensesSelling, informational and administrative costs are expensed as incurred. Among other things, these expenses include the internal and external costs of marketing, advertising,
shipping and handling, information technology and legal defense. Advertising expenses totaled approximately 
$2.6 billion  in 2019, $3.1 billion in 2018 and $3.1 billion  in 2017. Production costs are expensed as incurred and the costs of radio time, television time and space in publications are expensed when the related advertising occurs.
K. Research and Development Expenses
R&D costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses include the costs of our proprietary R&D efforts, as well as costs
 incurred in connection with certain licensingarrangements. Before a compound receives regulatory approval, we record upfront and milestone payments made by us to third parties under licensing arrangements as
expense. Upfront payments are recorded when incurred, and milestone payments are recorded when the specific milestone has been achieved. Once a compound receives
regulatory approval, we record any milestone payments in 
Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization  and, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite life, we amortize the payments on a straight-line basis over the remaining agreement term or the expected product life cycle, whichever is shorter.

L. Amortization of Intangible Asse
ts, Depreciation and Certain Long-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets include:
•
Property, plant and equipment, less accumulated depreciation—These assets are recorded at cost and are increased by the cost of any  significant improvements afterpurchase. Property, plant and equipment assets, other than land and construction in progress, are depreciated on
 a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of theindividual assets. Depreciation begins when the asset is ready for its intended use. For tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are used as allowed by tax laws.
•
Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization—These acquired assets are recorded at fair value. Intangible assets with finite lives  are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives that are associated with marketed products are not amortized until a useful life can be
determined.
•
Goodwill—Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred for an acquired business over the assigned values of its net assets . Goodwill is not amortized.Amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds
and intellectual property is included in 
Amortization of intangible assets  as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization expense related to intangible assets that are associated with a single function and depreciation of property, plant and equipment are included in 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses
 and/or Research and development expenses,  as appropriate. We review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least
annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the
amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets.
Specifically:
•
For finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology rights, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, whenever impairmentindicators are present, we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset
, or asset group, and compare this estimated amount to thecarrying amount. If the carrying amount is found to be greater, we record an impairment loss for the excess of book
 value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of animpairment review, we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.
•
For indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as Brands and IPR&D assets, when necessary, we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss, if any, forthe excess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review other than for I
PR&D assets, we re-evaluate whether continuing to characterize theasset as indefinite-lived is appropriate.
•
For goodwill, when necessary, we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare that value to its book value. If the carrying amount is found to be greater, wethen determine the implied fair value of goodwill by subtracting the fair value of all the identifiable net assets other than goodwill from the fair value of 
the reporting unit andrecord an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of the book value of goodwill over the implied fair value.
Impairment reviews can involve a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. For information about
the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. M. Restructuring Charges and 
Certain Acquisition-Related CostsWe may incur restructuring charges in connection with acquisitions when we implement plans to restructure and integrate the acquired operations or in connection with our
cost-reduction and productivity initiatives. Included in 
Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs  are all restructuring charges, as well as certain other costs associated with acquiring and integrating an acquired business. If the restructuring action results in a change in the estimated useful life of
 an asset, that incremental impact isclassified in 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses  and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate. Termination costs are generally recorded when the actions are probable and estimable. Transaction costs, such as banking, legal, accounting and other similar costs incurred in connection with a business
acquisition are expensed as incurred
. Amounts recorded for restructuring charges and other associated costs can result from a complex series of judgments about future events
 and uncertainties and can relyheavily on estimates and assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. N. Cash Equivalents and Statement of 
Cash FlowsCash equivalents include items almost as liquid as cash, such as certificates of deposit and time deposits with maturity periods of three months or less when purchased. 
Ifitems meeting this definition are part of a larger investment pool, we classify them as 
Short-term investments . Cash flows associated with financial instruments designated as fair value or cash flow hedges may be included in operating, investing or financing activities, depending on the
classification of the items being hedged. Cash flows associated with financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified according to the na
ture of thehedge instrument. Cash flows associated with financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are classified according to 
their purpose and accountingnature.
O. Investments and Derivative Financial Instru
mentsOur investments are comprised of the following: public equity securities with readily determinable fair values, available-for-sale debt securities, held-to-maturity debt securities
(when we have both the positive intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity), private equity
 securities74
 
 2019 Financial Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
without readily determinable fair values and equity-method investments. The classification of an investment can depend on the nature of the
 investment, our intent and ability tohold the investment, and the degree to which we may exercise influence.
•
Public equity securities with readily determinable fair values are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other (income)/deductions—net. •
Available-for-sale debt securities are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other comprehensive income/(loss) until realized. •
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried at amortized cost.•
Private equity securities without readily determinable fair values and where we have no significant influence are measured at cost minus any impairment and plus or minuschanges resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.
•
For equity investments in common stock or in-substance common stock where we have significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, we usethe equity-method of accounting. Under the equity-method, we record our share of the investee’s income and expenses in 
Other (income)/deductions—net . The excess of the cost of the investment over our share of the underlying equity in the
 net assets of the investee as of the acquisition date is allocated to the identifiable assets andliabilities of the investee, with any remaining excess amount allocated to goodwill. Such investments are initially recorded at cost, which is the fair value of consideration paid
and typically does not include contingent consideration.
Realized gains or losses on sales of investments are determined by using the specific identification cost method.
We regularly evaluate all of our financial assets for impairment. For investments in debt and equity, when a decline in fair value, if any, is determined, an impairment charge is
recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value in various balance sheet categories (see 
Note 7A ), with changes in fair value reported in Net income  or, for derivative financial instruments in certain qualifying hedging relationships, in 
Other comprehensive income/(loss) (see Note 7F ). A single estimate of fair value and impairment reviews can involve a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and
assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. P. Tax Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax Contingencies
Tax Assets and Liabilities
Current tax assets primarily includes (i) tax effects associated with intercompany transfers of inventory within our combined group, which are recognized in the consolidated
statements of income when the inventory is sold to a third party, as well as (ii) income tax receivables that are expected to
 be recovered either as refunds from taxingauthorities or as a reduction to future tax obligations.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between 
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilitiesusing enacted tax rates and laws, including the impact of the TCJA enacted in December 2017. We
 provide a valuation allowance when we believe that our deferred tax assetsare not recoverable based on an assessment of estimated future taxable income that incorporates ongoing, prudent and
 feasible tax-planning strategies, that would beimplemented, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax assets. All deferred tax assets and liabilities within the same tax jurisdiction are presented as a net
 amount in thenoncurrent section of our consolidated balance sheet. Amounts recorded for valuation allowances can result from a complex series of judgments about future events
 anduncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. Other non-current tax assets 
primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result from the payment of income taxes  in anothertax jurisdiction. These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to minimize double taxation, commonly
referred to as the competent authority process. The recoverability of these assets, which we believe to be
 more likely than not, is dependent upon the actual payment of taxesin one tax jurisdiction and, in some cases, the successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction.
Other taxes payable
 in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 includes liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the noncurrent portion of the repatriation tax liability on the deemed repatriated accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings recorded in connection with the TCJA for which we elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal
Consolidated Income Tax Return, payment over eight years through 2026. For additional information, see 
Note 5D  for uncertain tax positions and Note 5A  for the repatriation tax liability.
Income Tax Contingencies
We account for income tax contingencies using a benefit recognition model. If we consider that a 
tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, based solely onthe technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit
 by determining the amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized uponsettlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that
 has full knowledge of all relevant information.Under the benefit recognition model, if our initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, we regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the
tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of 
theposition to “more likely than not”; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an audit resulting in a favorable settlement of tha
t tax year with theappropriate agency. We regularly re-evaluate our tax positions based on the results of audits of federal, state and
 local and foreign income tax filings, statute of limitationsexpirations, changes and clarification in tax law or receipt of new information that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to the
2019 Financial Report

more-likely-than-not standard. Liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash within the next 12 months. Interest
and penalties, if any, are recorded in 
Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income  and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related tax liability. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but
 our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potentialtax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such es
timates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or whenthe statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as
 discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formaladministrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to
 our uncertain tax positions, and suchchanges could be significant. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. Q. Pension and
 Postretirement Benefit PlansThe majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have
 both IRC-qualified andsupplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for
retirees and their eligible dependents. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined bene
fit plans as an asset or liability on our consolidatedbalance sheet. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable
benefit formula. Our pension and other postretirement obligations may include assumptions such as expected employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension
plans, the obligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to
the expected cost of providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those
 costs are shared with the employee or others (such as governmental programs).Plan assets are measured at fair value. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the
 service costs are recognized in Other (income)/deductions—net . Amounts recorded for pension and postretirement benefit plans can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and
 uncertainties and can rely heavily onestimates and assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. R. Legal and Environmental Contingencies
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other
product-related litigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. We record accruals for
these contingencies to the extent that we conclude tha
t a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimatethan any other amount within the range, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no
 amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount,we accrue the lowest amount in the range. We record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.
Amounts recorded for contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and
 assumptions.For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. S. Share-Based Payments
Our compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values
are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses  and/or Research and development expenses
, as appropriate. Amounts recorded for share-based compensation can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and
assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C . T. Leases
On January 1, 2019, we adopted a new accounting standard for leases. For 
further information, see Note 1B . We lease real estate, fleet, and equipment for use in our operations. Our leases generally have lease terms of 
1  to 30 years, some of which include options to terminate orextend leases for up to 
5  to 10 years or on a month-to-month basis. We include options that are reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the determination of lease terms.We may negotiate termination clauses in anticipation of any changes in market conditions, but generally these termination options are not exercised. Residual value
guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases with the exception of some fleet leases. In addition to base rent payments
, the leases may require us to paydirectly for taxes and other non-lease components, such as insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses, which may be dependent on
 usage or vary month-to-month. Variable lease payments amounted to 
$328 million  for the year ended December 31, 2019 . We have elected the practical expedient in the new standard to not  separatenon-lease components from lease components in calculating the amounts of ROU assets and lease liabilities for all underlying asset classes.
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract in accordance with guidance detailed in the new standard and
 we perform the lease classification test asof the lease commencement date. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for 
the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make leasepayments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the
lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date
in determining the present value of future payments.

. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, LicensingArrangements and Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements
A
. AcquisitionsArray BioPharma Inc.
On 
July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule medicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for 
$48  per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred for Array wasapproximately 
$11.2 billion  ( $10.9 billion, net of cash acquired). In addition, approximately $157 million  in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense and recorded in 
Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs in the consolidated statement of income in the third quarter of 2019
 (see Note 3 ). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash. Array’s portfolio includes the approved combined use of Braftovi (encorafenib) and Mektovi (binimetinib) for the treatment of BRAF
V600E- or BRAFV600K-mutant unresectable ormetastatic melanoma. The combination therapy has significant potential for long-term growth via expansion into additional areas of unmet need and is currently being
investigated in over 30 clinical trials across several solid tumor indications, including in BRAF-mutant mCRC, through collaborations with third parties. In December 2019, the
FDA accepted and granted priority review to our supplemental new drug application for Braftovi in combination with Erbitux (cetuximab) (Braftovi Doublet) in BRAF-mutant
mCRC. Pfizer has exclusive rights to commercialize Braftovi and Mektovi in the U.S. and Canada. In addition to the combination therapy for 
BRAF-mutant metastaticmelanoma, Array brings a broad pipeline of targeted cancer medicines in different stages of R&D, as well as a portfolio of out-licensed medicines, which may generate
milestones and royalties over time.
In connection with this acquisition, we provisionally recorded: (i) 
$7.2 billion  in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $1.8 billion  of Developed technology rights with a useful life of 
16 years ,  $4.0 billion of IPR&D and $1.4 billion for Licensing agreements ( $1.1 billion for technology in development –– indefinite-lived licensing agreements and$340 million
 for developed technology –– finite-lived licensing agreements with a useful life of 10 years ), (ii) $5.4 billion  of Goodwill, (iii) $1.3 billion  of net deferred tax liabilities and (iv) 
$451 million  of assumed long-term debt, which was paid in full in the third quarter of 2019. The allocation of the consideration transferred to  the assets acquired andthe liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized.
Therachon Holding AG
On July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on rare diseases, with assets in
development for the treatment of achondroplasia, a genetic condition and the most common form of short-limb dwarfism, for 
$340 million  upfront, plus potential milestone payments of up to 
$470 million  contingent on the achievement of key milestones in the development and commercialization of the lead asset. In 2018, we acquiredapproximately 
3%  of Therachon’s outstanding shares for $5 million . We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the  lead asset represented substantially allthe fair value of the gross assets acquired. The total fair value of 
the consideration transferred for Therachon was approximately $322 million , which consisted of $317 million  of cash and our previous 
$5 million  investment in Therachon. Therachon is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer. In connection with this asset acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million
 in Research and development expenses.AstraZeneca’s Small Molecule Anti-Infectives Business
On December 22, 2016, which fell in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 for our international operations, we acquired the development and commercialization rights to AstraZeneca’s
small molecule anti-infectives business, primarily outside the U.S., including the commercialization and development rights to the marketed products Zavicefta™ (ceftazidime-
avibactam), Merrem™/Meronem™ (meropenem) and Zinforo™ (ceftaroline fosamil), and the clinical development assets ATM-AVI and CXL (ceftaroline fosamil-AVI). In 2017,
under the terms of the agreement, we made payments of approximately 
$605 million  to AstraZeneca related to the transaction. We made an additional milestone payment of $125 million
 in our first fiscal quarter of 2018, we made a deferred payment of $175 million  to AstraZeneca in January 2019, and we made an additional milestone payment of $75 million
 in our third fiscal quarter of 2019. We may make payments of up to $600 million  to AstraZeneca if sales of Zavicefta™ exceed certain thresholds prior to January 1, 2026, as well as tiered royalties on sales of Zavicefta™ and ATM-AVI in certain markets for a period ending on the
 later of 10 years from first commercial sale or the loss ofpatent protection or loss of regulatory exclusivity. The total royalty payments are unlimited during the royalty term and the undiscounted payments are expec
ted to be in therange of approximately 
$315 million  to $542 million. The total fair value of consideration transferred for AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business was approximately 
$1.0 billion  inclusive of cash paid of $555 million  and the fair value of contingent consideration of $485 million  (which is composed of the fair values of the deferred payment, the 
$50 million  milestone payment made in the second quarter of 2017, the $125 million  milestone payment made in our first fiscal quarter of 2018, the $75 million
 milestone payment made in the third quarter of 2019, and the future expected  milestone and royalty payments). In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $894 million
 in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $728 million  in  Developed technology rights and $166 million  in IPR&D. We also recorded $92 million  in Other currentassets
 related to the economic value of inventory which was retained by AstraZeneca for sale on our behalf, $73 million  in Goodwill and $19 million  of net deferred tax liabilities. The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed has been completed.
Medivation, Inc.
On September 28, 2016, we acquired Medivation for 
$81.50  per share. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Medivation was approximately $14.3 billion  in cash (
$13.9 billion, net of cash acquired). Of this consideration, approximately $365 million  was not paid as of December 31, 2016, and was recorded in Other current liabilities.  The remaining consideration was paid as of 
December 31, 2017 . Medivation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Medivation is focused on developing and commercializing small molecules for oncology. Medivation’s portfolio includes Xtandi (enzalutamide). Xtandi is FDA-approved for the treatment of non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant

prostate cancer as well as metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer. Xtandi is being developed and commercialized through a collaboration with Astellas. Astellas has
exclusive commercialization rights for Xtandi outside the U.S. The Medivation portfolio also includes talazoparib, which was approved by the FDA in October 2018, under the
trade name Talzenna, for the treatment of adults with germline BRCA-mutated HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and is currently in development for
other types of cancer. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded 
$12.2 billion  in Identifiable intangible assets, primarily consisting of $8.1 billion  of Developed technologyrights
 with an average useful life of approximately 12  years and $4.1 billion  of IPR&D, and recorded $6.1 billion  of  Goodwill, $4.0 billion of net income tax liabilities, and $259 million
 of assumed contingent consideration of which $51 million  has been paid through December 31, 2019. In 2017 and 2016, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values initially recorded in 2016, which resulted in a reduction in 
Identifiable intangible assets  of approximately $1.0 billion  with a corresponding change to Goodwill
 and net income tax liabilities. The measurement period adjustments were recorded to better reflect market participant assumptions about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date. The 2017 results included a decrease of approximately 
$38 million  to Amortization of intangible assets which reflected the cumulative pre-tax impact of the measurement period adjustments to 
Identifiable intangible assets  that were amortized to the income statement since the acquisition date. The measurement period adjustments did not result from intervening events subsequent to the acquisition date. The final allocation of 
the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and theliabilities assumed has been completed.
B
. DivestituresSale of Hospira Infusion Systems Net Assets to ICU Medical, Inc.
On October 6, 2016, we announced that we entered into
 a definitive agreement under which ICU Medical, a global device manufacturer, agreed to acquire all of our globalinfusion systems net assets, HIS, for approximately 
$1 billion  in cash and ICU Medical common stock. HIS includes IV pumps, solutions, and devices. As a  result of theperformance of HIS relative to ICU Medical’s expectations, on January 5, 2017 we entered into a revised agreement with ICU Medical under which ICU Medical would acquire
HIS for up to approximately 
$900 million , composed of cash and contingent cash consideration, ICU Medical common stock and seller financing. The revised transaction closed on February 3, 2017. At closing, we received 
3.2 million  newly issued shares of ICU Medical common stock (as originally agreed), which we initially valued at approximately 
$428 million  (based upon the closing price of ICU Medical common stock on the closing date less a discount for lack of marketability) and which were reported as equity securities at fair value in 
Long-term investments  on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. Upon the sale o f these shares in 2018,we realized a full gain of 
$302 million  on these securities, although our income statement only reflects a gain of $47 million  as the balance of the previously unrealized gain was recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment upon the adoption of a new accounting s
tandard. We also received a promissory note in the amount of $75 million , which was repaid in full as of December 31, 2017, and net cash of approximately 
$200 million  before customary adjustments for net working capital, which was reported in Other investing activities, net
 on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year-ended December 31, 2017.  In addition, we are entitled to receive a contingent amount of up to anadditional 
$225 million  in cash based on ICU Medical’s achievement of certain cumulative performance targets for the combined company through December 31, 2019. The amount of contingent payment we will receive, if any, will be determined during the first half of 2020. We recognized a pre-tax gain of 
$1 million  in 2018 and a pre-tax loss of $55 million
 in 2017 in Other (income)/deductions––net, representing adjustments to amounts previously recorded in 2016 to write down the HIS net assets to fair value less costs to sell.
The sale of the HIS net assets was fully completed in all jurisdictions as of year-end 2018.
In connection with the sale transaction, we entered into certain transitional agreements designed to facilitate the orderly transition of 
the HIS net assets to ICU Medical. Theseagreements primarily related to administrative services, and were provided for a period of 24 months after the closing date. We will also manufacture and supply certain HIS
products for ICU Medical and ICU Medical will manufacture and supply certain retained Pfizer products for us after closing, generally for a term of five years. These
agreements are not material to Pfizer and none confers upon us the ability to influence the operating and
/or financial policies of ICU Medical subsequent to the sale.Contribution Agreement Between Pfizer and Allogene Therapeutics, Inc.
In April 2018, Pfizer and Allogene announced that the two companies entered into a
 contribution agreement for Pfizer’s portfolio of assets related to allogeneic CAR T therapy,an investigational immune cell therapy approach to treating cancer. Under this agreement, Allogene received from Pfizer rights to pre-clinical and clinical CAR T assets, all of
which were previously licensed to Pfizer from French cell therapy company, Cellectis, beginning in 2014 and French pharmaceutical company, Servier, beginning in 2015.
Allogene assumed responsibility for all potential financial obligations to both Cellectis and Servier. Pfizer continues to participate financially in the development of the CAR T
portfolio through an ownership stake in Allogene. Separately, Pfizer continues to maintain its approximate 
7%  ownership stake in Cellectis that was obtained in 2014 as part ofthe licensing agreement in which Pfizer obtained exclusive rights to pursue the development and commercialization of certain Cellectis CAR T therapies in exchange for an
upfront payment of 
$80 million , as well as potential future development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalties. In connection with the Allogene transaction, Pfizer recognized a non-cash 
$50 million  pre-tax gain in Other (income)/deductions––net in the second quarter of 2018 ,  representing the difference between the$127 million
 fair value of the equity investment received and the book value of assets  transferred (including an allocation of goodwill) (see Note 4 ). In October 2018, Allogene consummated an initial public offering of new shares of its common stock, which resulted in Pfizer’s preferred stock converting into common stock
and a decrease in our ownership percentage from approximately 
25%  to approximately 18%  as of December 31, 2018. The closing price on the day of the initial public offeringwas 
$25 per share. Beginning as of the date of the initial public offering, our investment in Allogene is being measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in netincome (see 
Note 4 ). 2019 Financial Report

Sale of Phase 2b Ready AMPA Receptor Potentiator for CI
AS to Biogen Inc.In April 2018, we sold our Phase 2b ready AMPA receptor potentiator for CIA
S to Biogen. We received $75 million  upfront and have the opportunity to receive up to $515 million
 in total development and commercialization milestones, as well as tiered royalties in the low-to-mid-teen percentages. We recognized the $75 million  upfront payment in Other (income)/deductions––net
 in the second quarter of 2018 (see Note 4 ). In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized an additional $10 million  milestone in Other (income)/deductions––net
 (see Note  4). We will record the other milestones and royalties to Other (income)/deductions––net  when due, or earlier if we have sufficient experience to determine such amounts are not probable of significant reversal.
Divestiture of Neuroscience Assets
In September 2018, we and Bain Capital entered into a transaction to create a
 new biopharmaceutical company, Cerevel, to continue development of a portfolio of clinical andpreclinical stage neuroscience assets primarily targeting disorders of the central nervous system including Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia
and addiction. These assets were part of the neuroscience discovery and early development efforts, which we announced we were ending in January 2018. In
 connection withthis transaction, we out-licensed the portfolio to Cerevel in exchange for a 
25%  ownership stake in Cerevel’s parent company, Cerevel Therapeutics, Inc., and potential futureregulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalties. Bain Capital has committed to invest 
$350 million  to develop the portfolio, with the potential for additional funding as the assets advance. In connection with the transaction,
 we recognized a non-cash $343 million  pre-tax gain in Other (income)/deductions––net in the third quarter of 2018, representing the fair value of the equity investment received as the assets transferred
 had a book value of $0  (see Note 4 ). Our investment in Cerevel Therapeutics, Inc. is reported in 
Long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019  and December 31, 2018 . C. Equity-Method Investments and 
Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale Formation of a New Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture
On 
July 31, 2019, we completed the transaction in which we and GSK combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new consumer healthcare joint venture that operates globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. In exchange for contributing our Consumer Healthcare business to the joint venture, we received a 
32% equity stake in the new company and GSK owns the remaining 
68% . Upon the closing of the transaction, we deconsolidated our Consumer Healthcare business andrecognized a pre-tax gain of 
$8.1 billion  ( $5.4 billion, net of tax) in our fiscal third quarter of 2019 in (Gain) on completion of Consumer Healthcare JV transaction  for the difference in the fair value of our 
32%  equity stake in the new company and the carrying value of our Consumer Healthcare business. We may record additional adjustments tothe gain in future periods, which we do not expect to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In valuing our investment in GSK Consumer Healthcare, we used discounted cash flow techniques. Some of the
 more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in thisapproach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which include the expected impact o
f competitive, legal or regulatory forces on the products; the long-term growth rate, which seeks to project the sustainable growth rate over the long term; the discount rate
, which seeks to reflect our best estimate of the various risks inherentin the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the
 geographic diversity of the projected cash flows. As part of the joint venture transaction, we agreedto indemnify GSK with respect to certain tax matters related to periods prior to closing of 
the transaction as well as certain potential environmental or other legal liabilitiesassociated with the previous operation of our Consumer Healthcare business. We recognized a liability of 
$45 million  with respect to the tax matters indemnification. The value of the environmental and legal indemnifications was not considered to be material.
We are accounting for our interest in GSK Consumer Healthcare as an equity-method investment. The carrying value of our investment in GS
K Consumer Healthcare isapproximately 
$17.0 billion  and it is reported as a private equity investment in the Equity-method investments line in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 . Our consolidated statement of income for 2019 includes revenues and expenses associated with Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare business through 
July 31, 2019 . We record our share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare joint venture on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in 
Other (income)/deductions––net  commencing from August 1, 2019. Therefore, we recorded our share of two months of the joint venture’s earnings generated in the third quarter of 2019 
totaling $47 million  in our operating results in the fourth quarter of 2019. As of the July 31, 2019 closing date
, we estimated that the fair value of our investment in GSK Consumer Healthcare was approximately $15.7 billion  and 32% of the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of 
GSK Consumer Healthcare was approximately $11.2 billion  resulting in an initial basis difference of approximately 
$4.5 billion . In the fourth quarter of 2019, we preliminarily completed the allocation of the basis difference, which resulted from the excess  of the initial fair valueof our investment over the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of
 the joint venture, primarily to inventory, definite-lived intangible assets, indefinite-livedintangible assets, related deferred tax liabilities and equity method goodwill within the investment account. We recorded the amortization of basis differences allocated to
inventory, definite-lived intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities in 
Other (income)/deductions––net  commencing August 1, 2019. The amortization of these basis differences for two months of the third quarter of 2019 totaling approximately 
$31 million  is included in our operating results in the fourth quarter of 2019. Amortization of basis differences on inventory and related deferred tax liabilities will be completely recognized by the first quarter of 2020. Basis differences on definite-lived intangible assets and
related deferred tax liabilities are being amortized over approximately 
17 years . The increase in the value of our investment from the closing date to December 31, 2019 is primarily due to foreign currency translation adjustments (see 
Note 6 ). While we have received our full 
32%  interest in GSK Consumer Healthcare as of the July 31, 2019  closing and transferred control of our Consumer Healthcare business to GSK Consumer Healthcare, the contribution of the business was not completed in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions due to temporary regulatory or operational constraints. In 
thesejurisdictions, we have continued to operate the business for the net economic benefit of 
GSK Consumer Healthcare, and we are indemnified by GSK Consumer Healthcareagainst risks associated with such operations during the interim period, subject to our obligations under the definitive transaction agreements. We expect the contribution of
 our80

Consumer Healthcare business in these jurisdictions to be fully completed by the first half of 2021. As such, and as
 we and GSK Consumer Healthcare are contractuallyobligated to complete the transaction, we have treated these jurisdictions as sold for accounting purposes.
In connection with the contribution of our Consumer Healthcare business, we entered into certain transitional agreements designed to facilitate the orderly transition of the
business to GSK Consumer Healthcare. These agreements primarily relate to administrative services, which are generally to be provided for a period of up to 
24 months  after the closing date. We will also manufacture and supply certain consumer products for GSK Consumer Healthcare and GSK Consumer Healthcare will manufacture and supply
certain retained Pfizer products for us after closing, generally for a term of up to 
six years . These agreements are not material to Pfizer. Assets and liabilities associated with our Consumer Healthcare business were reclassified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. The
Consumer Healthcare business assets held for sale are reported in 
Assets held for sale  and Consumer Healthcare business liabilities held for sale are reported in Liabilities held for sale

Investment in Hisun Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Company Limited
In September 2012, we and Hisun, a leading pharmaceutical company in China, formed a new company, Hisun Pfizer, to develop, manufacture, market and sell
pharmaceutical products, primarily branded generic products, predominately in China. Hisun Pfizer was established with registered capital of 
$250 million , of which our portion was 
$122.5 million. As a result of the contributions from both parties, Hisun Pfizer holds a broad port folio of branded generics covering cardiovascular disease, infectiousdisease, oncology, mental health and other therapeutic areas.
We accounted for our interest in Hisun Pfizer as an equity-method investment, due to the
 significant influence we had over the operations of Hisun Pfizer through our boardrepresentation, minority veto rights and 
49%  voting interest. Our investment in Hisun Pfizer was reported in Long-term investments , and our share of Hisun Pfizer’s net income was recorded in 
Other (income)/deductions––net. On November 10, 2017, we sold our 
49%  equity share in Hisun Pfizer to Sapphire I (HK) Holdings Limited, an investment fund managed by Hillhouse Capital, for a total of$286 million
 in cash which included our carrying value of $270 million  in cash plus $16 million  to cover certain taxes incurred on the transaction. As a result of the saletransaction, we recognized a loss of 
$81 million  in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the recognition in earnings of the currency translation adjustment associated  with ourinvestment. After the sale transaction, Hisun Pfizer changed its name but retained its
 current rights to manufacture, sell and distribute all of Hisun Pfizer’s currently marketedand pipeline products in China. We are providing technical, manufacturing and regulatory services in connection with a technology transfer process being run by Hisun Pfizer to
support Hisun Pfizer’s objective that the products that we had previously licensed to Hisun Pfizer, will in the future, be manufac
tured locally in China. We continue to supplycertain products to Hisun Pfizer for a period of time, after the sale transaction, 
to facilitate a smooth transition.Investment in Laboratório Teuto Brasileiro S.A.
We entered into an agreement on June 30, 2017 to exit our investment in Teu
to, a 40% -owned generics company in Brazil, and sell our 40%  interest in Teuto to the majorityshareholders. As part of the agreement, we waived our option to acquire the remaining 
60%  of Teuto, and Teuto’s other shareholders have waived their option to sell their 60% stake in the company to us. As a result, in the
 second quarter of 2017, we recognized a net loss of approximately $30 million  in Other (income)/deductions––net (see Note 4 ), which included the impairment of our equity-method investment in Teuto, the reversal of a contingent liability associated with the majority shareholders’ option to sell their 
60% stake in the company to us, and the recognition in earnings of the currency translation adjustment associated
 with the Teuto investment. The transaction closed on August 16,2017.
D. Licensing Arrangements
Akcea Therapeutics, Inc.
In October 2019, we entered into a worldwide exclusive licensing agreement for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, an investigational antisense therapy being developed to treat pa
tientswith certain cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, with Akcea, a majority-owned affiliate of Ionis. The transaction closed in November 2019 and we made an upfront payment
of 
$250 million to Akcea and Ionis, which was recorded in Research and development expenses in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2019. Under the terms of the agreement, Akcea and Ionis will split equally the 
$250 million  upfront license fee. We may be required to make development, regulatory and sales milestone payments of up to $1.3 billion  and tiered, double-digit royalties on annual worldwide net sales upon marketing approval of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx and these payments will also be split equally between Akcea
and Ionis. Pfizer is responsible for all development and regulatory activities and costs beyond those associated with the ongoing Phase 2
 study.Shire International GmbH
In 2016, we out-licensed PF-00547659, an investigational biologic being evaluated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative
colitis and Crohn’s disease, to Shire for an upfront payment of 
$90 million , up to $460 million  in development and sales-based milestone payments and potential future royalty payments on commercialized products. The 
$90 million  upfront payment was initially deferred and recognized in Other (income)/deductions––net  ratably through December 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, we recognized 
$75 million  in Other (income)/deductions––net for a milestone payment received from Shire related to their first dosing of a patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial of the compound for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, and in 
the third quarter of 2018, we recognized $35 million  in Other(income)/deductions––net
 for a milestone payment received from Shire related to their first dosing of a patient in a Phase 3  clinical trial of the compound for the treatment ofCrohn’s disease (see 
Note 4 ). BionTech AG
In August 2018, a multi-year R&D arrangement went into effect between BionTech A
G (BionTech), a privately held company, and Pfizer to develop mRNA-based vaccines forprevention of influenza (flu). In September 2018, we made an upfront payment of 
$50 million  to BionTech, which was recorded in Research and development expenses, and BionTech became eligible to receive up to an additional 
$325 million  in future development and sales based milestones and future royalty payments associated with worldwide sales. As part of the transaction, we also purchased 
169,670  newly-issued ordinary shares of BionTech for $50 million  in the third quarter of 2018, which are reported in Long- term investments 
in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019  and December 31, 2018. E. 
Research and Development and Collaborative ArrangementsResearch and Development Arrangement with NovaQuest Co-Investment Fund V, L.P.
In April 2016, Pfizer entered into an agreement with NovaQuest under which NovaQuest would fund up to
 $200 million in development costs related to certain Phase 3 clinicaltrials of Pfizer’s rivipansel compound and Pfizer would use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for such compound. NovaQuest’s
development funding was expected to cover up to
 100% of the development2019 Financial Report

costs and was received over approximately 13 quarters from 2016 through the second quarter of 2019 after which Pfizer would be responsible for the remaining development
costs. As there was a substantive and genuine transfer of risk to
 NovaQuest, the development funding was recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual servicesand therefore a reduction of 
Research and development expenses  as incurred. The funding cap was reached in 2019.  The reduction to Research and Development expenses totaled 
$24 million  for 2019, $58 million  for 2018 and $72 million  for 2017. In August 2019, we announced that the 
Phase 3 RESET (Rivipansel Evaluating Safety, Efficacy and Time to Discharge) pivotal study did not meet its primary or key secondaryefficacy endpoints. The objective of the trial was to evaluate the e
fficacy and safety of rivipansel in patients aged six and older with sickle cell disease who were hospitalized fora vaso-occlusive crisis and required treatment with IV opioids. As a result, in 2019, we recorded a 
$99 million  charge in Cost of sales related to rivipansel ,  primarily forinventory manufactured for expected future sale
, as well as $15 million  of anticipated clinical development program close-out costs, which were recorded in Research and development costs 
in the consolidated statement of income. In January 2020, we discontinued development of rivipansel resulting in the termination of the  R&D arrangementwith NovaQuest. No payments have been or are expected to be received from or paid to NovaQuest
 as part of the termination of the arrangement.Research and Development Arrangement with RPI Finance Trust
In January 2016, Pfizer entered into an agreement with RPI, a subsidiary of Royalty Pharma, under which RPI
 would fund up to $300 million in development costs related tocertain Phase 3 clinical trials of Pfizer’s Ibrance (palbociclib) product primarily for adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor positive early breast cancer (the Indication). RPI’s
development funding is expected to cover up to
 100% of the costs primarily for the applicable clinical trials until the first quarter of 2020 after which Pfizer will be responsible forthe remaining cost of the trials. As there is a substantive and genuine transfer o
f risk to RPI, the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to performcontractual services and therefore is a reduction of 
Research and development expenses  as incurred. The reduction to Research and development expenses  totaled  $63million
 for 2019, $99 million for 2018 and $76 million  for 2017.  If successful and upon approval of Ibrance in the U.S. or certain major markets in the EU for the Indication basedon the applicable clinical trials, RPI will be eligible to receive a combination of approval-based fixed milestone payments of up to
 $250 million dependent upon results of theclinical trials and royalties on certain Ibrance sales over approximately seven years. Fixed milestone payments due upon approval will be recorded as intangible assets and
amortized to 
Amortization of intangible assets  over the estimated commercial life of the Ibrance product and sales-based royalties will be recorded as Cost of sales  when incurred.
Collaborative Arrangements
In the normal course of business, we enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to in-line medicines, as well as medicines in development that require completion of
research and regulatory approval. Collaborative arrangements are contractual agreements with third parties that involve a joint operating activity, typically a research and/or
commercialization effort, where both we and our partner are active participants in the activity and are exposed to the significant risks and rewards of the ac
tivity. Our rights andobligations under our collaborative arrangements vary. For example, we have agreements to co-promote pharmaceutical products discovered by us or other companies, and
we have agreements where we partner to co-develop and/or participate together in commercializing, marketing, promoting, manufacturing and/or distributing a drug product.
The following table provides the amounts and classification of payments (income/(expense)) between us and our collaboration partners:

collaboration with Merck (see below) of 
$40 million  in 2018 in Other (income)/deductions––net and $150 million in 2017, substantially all of which was included in the adjustment to increase the opening balance of 
Retained earnings  upon the adoption of a new accounting standard for revenue recognition, effec tive January 1, 2018.Collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc.
Under a worldwide collaboration agreement, except for Japan, we collaborated with Merck on the clinical development of ertugliflozin and ertugliflozin-containing fixed-dose
combinations with metformin and Januvia (sitagliptin) tablets, which were approved by the FDA in December 2017 and the EC in March 2018 as Steglatro, Segluromet and
Steglujan. Merck exclusively promotes Steglatro and the two fixed-dose combination products and we share revenues and certain costs with Merck on a 
60% /40% basis, withPfizer having the 
40%  share.In the first quarter of 
2017 , we received a $90 million  milestone payment from Merck upon the FDA’s acceptance for review of the NDAs for ertugliflozin and two fixed-dose combinations (ertugliflozin plus Januvia (sitagliptin) and ertugliflozin plus metformin), which, as of December 31, 2017, was deferred and primarily reported in 
Other noncurrent liabilities, 
and through December 31, 2017, was being recognized in Other (income)/deductions––net  over a multi-year period. As of December 31, 2017, we were due a $60 million
 milestone payment from Merck, which we received in the first quarter of 2018, in conjunction with the approval of ertugliflozin by the FDA. As  of December 31, 2017, the$60 million
 due from Merck was deferred and primarily reported in Other noncurrent liabilities . In the first quarter of 2018, in connection with the  approval of ertugliflozin in theEU, we recognized a 
$40 million  milestone payment from Merck in Other (income)/deductions––net  (see Note 4 ). We are eligible for additional payments associated with the achievement of future commercial milestones. In the first quarter of 2018, in connection with the adoption o
f a new accounting standard for revenue recognition, as of January1, 2018, the 
$60 million  of deferred income and approximately $85 million  of the $90 million  of deferred income associated with the above-mentioned milestone payments were recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to 
Retained earnings . Collaboration with Eli Lilly & Company
In 2013, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Lilly to jointly develop and globally commercialize Pfizer’s tanezumab, which provides that Pfizer and Lilly will equally
share product-development expenses as well as potential revenues and certain product-related costs. We received a 
$200 million  upfront payment from Lilly in accordance with the collaboration agreement between Pfizer and Lilly, which was deferred and primarily reported in 
Other noncurrent liabilities, and through December 31, 2017, was being recognized in 
Other (income)/deductions––net  over a multi-year period beginning in the second quarter of 2015. Pfizer and Lilly resumed the Phase 3 chronic pain program for tanezumab in July 2015. Under the collaboration agreement with Lilly, we are eligible to receive additional payments from Lilly upon the achievement of specified
regulatory and commercial milestones. In the first quarter of 2018, in connection with the adoption of a new accounting s
tandard for revenue recognition, as of January 1,2018, approximately 
$107 million  of deferred income associated with the above-mentioned upfront payment was recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to Retained earnings
. Approximately $9 million  of the upfront payment continues to be deferred, and  is reported in Other current liabilities  as of December 31, 2019 . This amount is being recognized in
 Other (income)/deductions––net  over the remaining development period for the product in 2020. Collaboration with Merck KGaA
In November 2014, we entered into a collaborative arrangement with Merck KGaA, to jointly develop and commercialize avelumab, currently approved as Bavencio for
metastatic MCC in the U.S., the EU, Japan and select o
ther markets, in combination with Inlyta for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC in the U.S., the EU,Japan and select other markets, as well as for the second-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in the U.S.
 and select othermarkets. Avelumab is also in development as a potential treatment for multiple other types of cancer. We and Merck K
GaA are exploring the therapeutic potential of this novelanti-PD-L1 antibody as a single agent as well as in various combinations with our and Merck KGaA’s broad portfolio of approved and investigational oncology therapies. Also,
as part of the agreement, we gave Merck KGaA certain co-promotion rights for Xalkori in the U.S.
 and several other key markets. Under the terms of the agreement, in thefourth quarter of 2014, we made an upfront payment of 
$850 million  to Merck KGaA and Merck KGaA is eligible to receive regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to approximately 
$2.0 billion . During 2017, we made $140 million  in milestone payments to Merck KGaA, which were recorded in Identifiable intangible assets –– Developedtechnology rights, 
for approvals of avelumab received in 2017 for the MCC indication in the U.S., the EU and Japan, and  for the metastatic urothelial carcinoma indication in theU.S. 
Both companies jointly fund the majority of development and commercialization costs, and split equally any profits related to net sales generated from selling any products containing avelumab from this collaboration.
 In December 2018, both companies amended the collaborative agreement such that Pfizer will be solely responsible for the development and commercialization of its anti PD-1 antibody. Under the terms of the amended agreement, we paid Merck KGaA an up-front payment
 and we will make apotential milestone and tiered royalty payments should the Pfizer anti PD-1 antibody achieve regulatory and commercial success. We made 
$80 million  in milestone payments to Merck KGaA, which were recorded in 
Identifiable intangible assets –– Developed technology rights, for the U.S. and the EU approvals received in 2019 related to the  use ofBavencio in combination with Inlyta for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC.
Note 3
. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/ProductivityInitiatives
We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring, integrating and restructuring businesses and in connection with our global cost-reduction/productivity initiatives. For
example:
•
In connection with acquisition activity, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which may includeexpenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes), and restructuring the combined company (which may include charges related to employees,
assets and activities that will not continue in the combined company); and
•
In connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges associated with site closings and other facility rationalization actions,workforce reductions and the expansion of shared services, including the development of global systems.

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
All of our businesses and functions may be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and R&D, as well as groups such as
 informationtechnology, shared services and corporate operations.
2017-2019 Initiatives and Organizing for Growth
During 2018, we determined that at the start of our 2019 fiscal year, we would begin operating under our new commercial structure, which reorganized our operations into three
businesses
–– Biopharma, a science-based innovative medicines business; Upjohn, a global, primarily off-patent branded and generic established medicines business; andthrough July 31, 2019, a Consumer Healthcare business (See 
Note 17 ). To operate effectively in this structure and position ourselves for future growth, we focused on  creatinga simpler, more efficient operating structure within each business as well as the functions that support them. Beginning in the 
fourth quarter of 2018, we reviewed previouslyplanned initiatives and new initiatives to ensure that there was alignment around our new structure and combined the 2017-2019 initiatives with our Organizing for Growth
initiatives to form one cohesive plan. Initiatives for the combined program included activities related to the optimization of our manufacturing plant network, the centralization of
our corporate and platform functions, and the simplification and optimization of our operating business structure and functions that support
 them. From 2017 through December31, 2019, we incurred approximately 
$921 million  associated with manufacturing optimization, approximately $1.2 billion  associated with other activities, and have substantially completed this program.
Transforming to a More Focused Company
With the formation of the GSK Consumer Healthcare venture and the pending combination of Upjohn with Mylan, P
fizer is transforming itself into a more focused, global leaderin science-based innovative medicines. As a result, we began in the fourth quarter of 2019, to identify
 and undertake efforts to ensure our cost base aligns appropriately withour Biopharmaceutical revenue base as a result of both the completed Consumer Healthcare and expected Upjohn transactions. While certain direct costs have transferred or
will transfer to the Consumer Healthcare joint venture and to the Upjohn entities, there are indirect costs which are not expected to 
transfer. In addition, we are taking steps torestructure our organizations to appropriately support and drive the purpose of the three core functions of our focused innovative medicines business: R&D, Manufac
turing andCommercial.
We expect the costs associated with this multi-year effort to continue through 2022
 and to total approximately $1.4 billion  on a pre-tax basis and approximately 10%  of this tobe non-cash. Actions may include, among others, changes in location of certain activities, expanded use and co-location of
 centers of excellence and shared services, andincreased use of digital technologies. The associated actions and the specific costs are currently in development but will include severance and benefit plan impacts, exit costs
as well as associated implementation costs.
Current-Period Key Activities
In 
2019, we incurred costs of $967 million  composed of $695 million  associated with 2017-2019 Initiatives and Organizing for Growth, $288 million  associated with the integration of Array, 
$94 million  associated with the integration of Hospira, and $87 million  associated with the Transforming to a More Focused Company initiative, partially offset by income of 
$197 million , primarily due to the reversal of certain accruals upon the effective favorable settlement of a U.S . IRS audit for multiple tax years and otheracquisition-related initiatives.
The following table provides the components of costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives:

(b)
 In 2019, restructuring charges mainly represent employee termination costs associated with cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, partially offset by the reversal of certain accruals related to our acquisition ofWyeth upon the effective favora
ble settlement of a U.S. IRS audit for multiple tax years (see Note 5B ). In 2018, restructuring charg es were primarily related to employee termination costs and asset write downs.The employee termination costs for 
2019 and 2018 were primarily associated with our improvements to operational effectiveness as part of the realignment of our organizational structure, and for 2019, alsoincludes employee terminatio
n costs associated with the Transforming to a More Focused Company initiative. In 2017 , restructuring charges were primarily associated with our acquisitions of Hospira andMedivation, partially offset by credits 
associated with cost-reduction and productivity initiatives not associated with acquisitions that mostly related to the reversal of previously recorded accruals for employeetermination costs resulting from revisio
ns of our severance benefit estimates. Employee termination costs are generally recorded when the actions are probable and estimable and include accrued severancebenefits, pension and p
ostretirement benefits, many of which may be paid out during periods after termination.The restructuring activities in 
2019  are associated with the following:•
Biopharma ($118 million  charge); Upjohn ( $75 million  charge); and Other ( $180 million  charge). At the beginning of fiscal 20
19, we revised our operating segments and are unable to directly associate 2018 and 2017 restructuring charges with the new individual segments.The restructuring activities for 
2018  are associated with the following:•
Total reportable segments ($207 million  charge); and Other ( $575 million  charge). The restructuring activities for 
2017  are associated with the following:•
Total reportable segments ($89 million  credit); and Other ( $119 million  charge). (c)
 Transaction costs represent external costs for banking, legal, accounting and other similar services. In 2019, transaction costs relate to our acquisition of Array. In 2017, transaction costs were directly related toour acquisitions of Hospira, Anac
or and Medivation.(d)
 Integration costs and other represent external, incremental costs directly related to integrating acquired businesses, such as expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes, and certainother qualifying costs. In 
2019 , integration costs and other m ainly related to our acquisitions of Array (including $157 million  in payments to Array employees for t he fair value of previously unvested stock optionsthat was recognized as po
st-closing compensation expense (see Note 2A )) and Hospira. In 2018 , integration costs and other m ostly related to our acquisition of Hospira. In 2017, integration costs primarily relatedto our acquisitions of
 Hospira and Medivation, as well as a net gain of $12 million  related to the settlement of th e Hospira U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (see Note 11 ). (e)
 In 2018, primarily represents the net pension curtailments and settlements included in Other (income)/deduction s––net upon the adoption of a new accoun ting standard in the first quarter of 2018. In 2017, mainlyrepresents the net pensio
n curtailments and settlements, partially offset by net periodic benefit credits, excluding service costs, related to our acquisition of Hospira, both of which were reclassified to Other (income)/deductions––net
 as a result of the retrospective a doption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter of 2018. These credits included a net settlement gain, partially offset by acceleratedamortization of actuarial losses a
nd prior service costs upon the settlement of the remaining obligation associated with the Hospira U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan. For additional information, see Note 11

 2019 v. 2018––Interest income decrease d primarily driven by a lower investment balance. Interest expense increased mainly as a result of an increased commercial paper balance due to the acquisition of Array,as well as the retirement of lower-co
upon debt and the issuance of new debt with a higher coupon than the debt outstanding for the comparative prior year period. 2018  v. 2017––Interest income decreased primarily driven by a lower investment 
balance. Interest expense increased primarily as a result of higher short-term interest rates, offset, in part, by refinancing activity that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017.Capitalized interest e
xpense totaled $88 million  in 2019, $ 73 million in 2018 and $ 72 million  in 2017. (b)
 Royalty-related income increased  in 2019, primarily due to a one-time favor able resolution in the second quarter of 2019  of a legal dispute for $82 million . (c)
 In 2018, primarily included a realized g ain on sale of property of $60 million . In 2017, primarily included an $81 million  realized loss related to the sal e of our former 49% -owned equity-method investment in HisunPfizer and a realized net loss of 
$30 million  related to the sale of  our former 40%  ownership investment in Teuto, including the extinguishment of a put option for the then remaining 60%  ownership interest,partially offset by a realized gai
n on sale of property of $52 million . (d)
 The gains in 2019 include, among other things, unrealized gains of $295 million  related to investments in Cortexyme, I nc. and SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc. The gains in 2018  included unrealized gains on equity securities of

all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset and then applied an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the moresignificant estimates and assumpti
ons inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces onthe product; the discount rat

 The 2018 current tax benefit and deferred tax expense primarily relate to the utilization of tax credit carryforwards against the repatriation tax liability associated with the enactment of the TCJA. See discussionbelow and 
Note 5C . In
 the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an estimate of certain tax effects of the TCJA, including (i) the impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities from the reduction in theU.S. Federal corporate tax
 rate from 35% to 21% , (ii) the impact on valuation allowances and other state income tax considerations, (iii) the $15.2 billion  repatriation tax liability on
 accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings for which we elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, payment over eight years through2026 and (iv) deferred taxes on basi
s differences expected to give rise to future taxes on global intangible low-taxed income. In addition, we had provided deferred tax liabilitiesin
 the past on foreign earnings that were not indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the TCJA, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we reversed an estimate of the deferred taxes thatare no longer expected to be needed due to the change to
 the territorial tax system.In
 2018, we finalized our provisional accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA, based on our best estimates of available information and data, and reported and disclosed theimpacts
 within the applicable measurement period, in accordance with guidance issued by the SEC, and recorded a favorable adjustment of approximately $100  million to Provision/(benefit)
 for taxes on income.  We believe that there may be additional interpretations, clarifications and guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury. Any changeto
 our calculations resulting from such additional interpretations, clarifications and guidance would be reflected in the period of issuance. In addition, our obligations may varyas a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and
 other credit carryforwards.With
 respect to the aforementioned repatriation tax liability, our revised estimate is approximately $15 billion ,  which is reported in current Income taxes payable  (approximately $600 million
) and  the remaining liability is reported in noncurrent Other taxes payable in our  consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. The first installment of $750 million
 was paid in April 2019. The TCJA subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staf
f Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5,Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income
, states that we are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes  for temporary basisdifferences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years or provide for the tax expense related to such income in the year the
 tax is incurred. Weelected to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years. In 2017, we provided a provisional
deferred tax liability of approximately 
$1.0 billion  based on the evaluation of certain temporary differences inside each of our foreign subsidiaries that are expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income. In 2018, this estimate was finalized and we provided for an additional deferred tax liability of approximately 
$200 million , resulting in a deferred tax liability of approximately 
$1.2 billion . In 2019, the
 Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income  was impacted by the following: •
tax expense of approximately $2.7 billion  associated with the gain related to the completion of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture transaction with GSK; •
tax benefits of approximately $1.6 billion , representing tax and interest resulting from the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years, primarily resulting from a favorable settlement with the IRS (see 
Note 5D  below); •
tax benefits of approximately $400 million  related to certain tax initiatives associated with the implementation of our new organizational structure; 90

•
tax benefits of approximately $325 million  recorded as a result of additional guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury related to the  enactment of the TCJA; and•
tax benefits of approximately $620 million  related to certain asset impairments. In 2018, the
 Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income  was impacted by the following: •
estimated U.S. net tax benefits of approximately $600 million  associated with the enactment of the TCJA (see discussion above), primarily reflecting: ◦
approximately $500 million  of tax benefits associated primarily with certain 2018 tax initiatives; ◦
approximately $100 million  of tax benefits associated with adjustments to our provisional accounting for the tax  effects of the TCJA, reported and disclosed within theapplicable measurement period, in accordance with guidance issued by the SEC, mainly consisting of:
◦
$160 million of tax benefits related to the repatriation tax on deemed repatriated accumulated earnings of  foreign subsidiaries; and◦
$140 million of tax benefits associated with the remeasurement of other U.S.  deferred tax liabilities,partially offset by:
◦
$200 million of tax expense related to future taxes on global intangible low-taxed income; •
tax benefits of approximately $700 million  representing tax and interest resulting from the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years mostly with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations; and
•
tax benefits of approximately $740 million  related to certain asset impairments. In 2017, the
 Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income  was impacted by the following: •
estimated U.S. net tax benefits of $10.7 billion  associated with the enactment of the TCJA (see discussion above), primarily reflecting: ◦
$22.8 billion of tax benefits associated with the remeasurement of U.S. de ferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries (see Note 5C ); ◦
$1.6 billion of tax benefits associated with the remeasurement of other U.S.  deferred tax liabilities, mainly associated with intangibles (see Note 5C ); ◦
$12.9 billion of tax expense related to the repatriation tax on deemed repatriated accumulated pre-2017 post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiaries;◦
$1.0 billion of tax expense related to future taxes on global intangible low-taxed income (see Note 5C ); and ◦
approximately $100 million  of tax benefits mostly associated with certain tax initiatives; •
U.S. tax expense of approximately $1.3 billion  related to the repatriation tax on deemed repatriated current year earnings of foreign subsidiaries; •
tax benefits of approximately $370 million  related to net losses on early retirement of debt; •
tax benefits of approximately $150 million  representing tax and interest resulting from the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations; and

 For a discussion about the enactment of the TCJA, see Note 5A. (b)
 For taxation of non-U.S. operations, this rate impact reflects the income tax rates and relative earnings in the locations where we do business outside the U.S., together with the cost of repatriation decisions,which, for 2017, include
s the repatriation tax on deemed repatriated 2017 earnings of foreign subsidiaries discussed in Note 5A , changes in uncertain tax p ositions not included in the reconciling item called “Taxsettlements and resolution of c
ertain tax positions,” as well as changes in valuation allowances. Specifically: (i) the jurisdictional location of earnings is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year,and the rate impact of this comp
onent is influenced by the specific location of non-U.S. earnings and the level of such earnings as compared to our total earnings; (ii) the cost of repatriation decisions, and otherU.S. tax implications of our foreign o
perations, is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year and generally offsets some of the reduction to our effective tax rate each year resulting from thejurisdictional locat
ion of earnings; (iii)2019 Financial Report

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
certain tax initiatives; and (iv) the imp
act of changes in uncertain tax positions not included in the reconciling item called “Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions” is a component of our effective taxrate each year that can result i
n either an increase or decrease to our effective tax rate. The jurisdictional mix of earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings as well as repatriation costs, canvary as a result of the repatriatio
n decisions, as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and as a result of the extent and location of other income and expense items, such asrestructuring charges, asset impairm
ents and gains and losses on strategic business decisions. See also Note 5A for the components of pre -tax income and Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income, which is based on the location of the taxin
g authorities, and for information about settlements and other items impacting Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income. (c)
 In all periods presented, the reduction in our effective tax rate resulting from the jurisdictional location of earnings is largely due to lower tax rates in certain jurisdictions, as well as manufacturing and otherincentives associated with our su
bsidiaries in Puerto Rico and Singapore. We benefit from a Puerto Rican incentive grant that expires in 2029. Under the grant, we are partially exempt from income, property andmunicipal taxes. In Singapore, w
e benefit from incentive tax rates effective through 2045 on income from manufacturing and other operations.(d)
 For a discussion about tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions, the impact of the gain on the completion of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture transaction and the impact of U.S. HealthcareLegislation, see 
Note 5A. (e)
 The favorable rate impact in 2018 is a result of the updated 2017 invoice received from the federal government, which reflected a lower expense than what was previously estimated for invoiced periods, as wellas certain tax initiatives.
(f)
 All other, net in 2019 is primarily due to routine business operations. 2018 is primarily due to routine business operations and the non-recurrence of tax benefits associated with certain tax initiatives. 2017 primarilyrelates to tax benefits associate
d with certain tax initiatives in the normal course of business.C. Deferred Taxes
Deferred taxes arise as a result of basis differentials between financial statement accounting and tax amounts.
The components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, shown before jurisdictional netting, follow:

  $7,288  $(11,988 )  $6,508  $(9,456 ) Net deferred tax liability
(e)     $(4,700 )     $(2,948 ) *
The deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with global intangible low-taxed income are included in the relevant categories above. See Note 5A . (a)
 The increase in 2019  is primarily related to the capitalizati on of certain R&D-related expenses.(b)
 The decrease in 2019  is primarily the result of amortization of i ntangible assets and certain impairment charges, mainly offset by deferred tax liabilities established on intangible assets from the acquisition ofArray.
(c)
 The amounts in 2019  and 2018  are reduced for unrecognized  tax benefits of $2.9 billion  and $3.3 billion , respectively, where we have net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, and/or tax creditcarryforwards that are available, 
under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction, to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position.(d)
 The increase in 2019 is primarily related to the Consumer Healthcare joint venture with GSK. See Note 2C  for additional information. (e)
 In 2019, Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ( $0.9 billion), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $5.6 billion). In 2018, Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets(
$0.8 billion), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $3.7 billion). We have carryforwards, primarily related to net operating and capital losses, general business credits and charitable contributions, which are available to reduce future U.S.
federal and/or state, as well as international, income taxes payable with either an indefinite life or expiring at various times from 2020 to 2039. Certain of our U.S
. net operatinglosses and general business credits are subject to limitations under IRC Section 382.
Valuation allowances are provided when we believe that our deferred tax assets are not recoverable based on an assessment of estimated future 
taxable income thatincorporates ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, that would be implemented, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax asse
ts.As of 
December 31, 2019 , we have not made a U.S. tax provision on approximately $29.0 billion  of unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries. As these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, the determination of a hypothetical unrecognized deferred tax liability as of 
December 31, 2019  is not practicable. 92

Tax ContingenciesWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions, and a certain degree of estimation is required in recording the assets and liabilities related to income taxes. All of our tax
positions are subject to audit by the local taxing authorities in each tax jurisdiction. These tax audits can involve complex issues, interpretations and judgments and
 theresolution of matters may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have

fits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variationfrom such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the sta
tutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discreteitems in the period of resolution.
For a description of our accounting policies associated with accounting for income tax contingencies, see 
Note 1P. For a description of the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. Uncertain Tax Positions
As tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, it is uncertain whether some of our tax
 positions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2019 , we had approximately 
$4.2 billion  in net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest and as of December 31, 2018 , we had approximately $5.1 billion  in net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest.
•
Tax assets associated with uncertain tax positions primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one  tax jurisdiction that could result from the payment ofincome taxes in another tax jurisdiction. These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to
 minimizedouble taxation, commonly referred to as the competent authority process. The recoverability of these assets,
 which we believe to be more likely than not, is dependent uponthe actual payment of taxes in one tax jurisdiction and, in some cases, the
 successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2019 , we had approximately 
$1.2 billion  in assets associated with uncertain tax positions. These amounts were included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets (
$1.0 billion) and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $109 million ). As of December 31, 2018 , we had approximately $1.1 billion  in assets associated with uncertain tax positions. These amounts were included in 
Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets  ( $1.0 billion) and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $128 million ). •
Tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions represent unrecognized tax benefits, which arise when the estimated benefit recorded in our financial statements differsfrom the amounts taken or expected to be taken in a 
tax return because of the uncertainties described above. These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issuescommon among multinational corporations. Substantially all of these unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate.
The reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits follows:

) and Other taxes payable  ( $2.4 billion). In 2018, included in Income taxes payable  ( $11 million), Current tax assets ( $1 million) Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ( $47million
), Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $3.2 billion) and Other taxes payable  ( $3.0 billion). •
Interest related to our unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in accordance with the laws of each jurisdiction and is recorded primarily in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income
 in our consolidated statements of income. In 2019 , we recorded a net decrease in interest of $564 million , resulting primarily from a settlement with the IRS. In 2018 , we recorded a net increase in interest of 
$103 million ; and in 2017 , we recorded a net increase in interest of $208 million . Gross accrued interest totaled $485 million  as of December 31, 2019
 (reflecting a decrease of approximately $13 million  as a result of cash payments) and gross accrued interest totaled $1.1 billion  as of December 31, 2018
 (reflecting a decrease of approximately $16 million  as a result of cash payments). In 2019 , this amount was included in Income taxes payable ( $20 million) and Other taxes payable
 ( $465 million). In 2018, this amount was included in Income taxes payable ( $6 million)  and Other taxes payable ( $1.1 billion). Accrued penalties are not significant. See also 
Note 5A. Status of Tax Audits and Potential Impact
 on Accruals for Uncertain Tax PositionsThe U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS:
•
During the second quarter of 2019, Pfizer reached settlement of disputed issues at the IRS Office of Appeals, thereby settling all issues related to U.S. tax returns of Pfizerfor the years 2009-2010. As a result of settling these years, in 
the second quarter of 2019 we recorded a benefit of approximately $1.4 billion , representing tax and interest. 2019 Financial Report

•
With respect to Pfizer, tax years 2011-2015 are currently under audit. Tax years 2016-2019 are open, but not under audit. All other tax years are closed.In addition to the open audit years in the U.S.,
 we have open audit years in other major tax jurisdictions, such as Canada (2013-2019), Japan (2017-2019), Europe (2011-2019,primarily reflecting Ireland, the U.K., France, Italy, Spain and Germany), Latin America (1998-2019, primarily reflecting Brazil) and Puerto Rico (2015-2019).
Any settlements or statutes of limitations expirations could result in a significant decrease in our uncertain tax positions. We estimate 
that it is reasonably possible that withinthe next 12 months, our gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest,
 could decrease by as much as $200 million , as a result of settlements with taxing authorities or the expiration of the statutes of limitations. Our assessments are based on
 estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimatesof unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not be
 representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financialstatements in the period of settlement or when the statutes
 of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing audits with therelevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to
our uncertain tax positions, and such changes could be significant.

The following inputs and valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities:
•
Available-for-sale debt securities—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and credit-adjustedinterest rate yield curves.
•
Equity securities with readily determinable fair values—quoted market prices and observable net asset value prices.•
Derivative assets and liabilities—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Where applicable,these models discount future cash flow amounts using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate yield curves, and forward and spot prices for currencies. The
credit risk impact to our derivative financial instruments was not significant.
•
Money market funds—observable net asset value prices.We periodically review the methodologies, inputs and outputs of third-party pricing services for reasonableness. Our procedures can include, for example, referencing other
third-party pricing models, monitoring key observable inputs (like LIBOR interest rates) and selectively performing test-comparisons of values with actual sales of financial
instruments.

$1.065 billion  principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2047 with an interest rate of 4.20% , and also in March 2017, we completed a public offering of €
4.0 billion  principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 0.23% . Retirements
In January 2019, we repurchased all 
€1.1 billion  ( $1.3 billion, at exchange rates on settlement) principal amount outstanding of the 5.75%  euro-denominated debt that was due June 2021 before the maturity date at a redemption value of 
€1.3 billion  ( $1.5 billion, at exchange rates on settlement). As a result, in the first quarter of 2019, we recorded anet loss of approximately 
$138 million , which included the related termination of cross-currency swaps, and is reported in Other (income)/deductions––net in the consolidated statements of income (see 
Note 4 ). In December 2017, we exchanged approximately 
£833 million  and repurchased £197 million  principal amount of the outstanding 6.50%  debt before the maturity date at a redemption value of 
£1.7 billion , leaving £470 million  principal amount of the 6.50%  debt due 2038 outstanding. Also, in December 2017, we repurchased approximately €834 million
 principal amount of the outstanding 5.75%  debt before the maturity date at a redemption value of €1.0 billion , leaving approximately €1.2 billion  of the 5.75%  euro- denominated debt due 2021 outstanding as of December 31, 2017. As a
 result, we recorded a net loss of approximately $846 million  and $153 million  upon the exchange and early retirement of the U.K. pound-denominated debt and the early retirement of the euro-denominated debt, respectively, for a
 net loss on early retirement of debt of $999 million
, which included the related termination of cross-currency swaps, and that were recorded in Other (income)/deductions––net  in the consolidated statement of income (see

E. Other Noncurrent Liabilities
Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin)
In April 2018, the EU approved Mylotarg for the treatment of acute
 myeloid leukemia. In connection with the EU approval, we incurred an obligation to make guaranteed fixedannual payments over a 
ten -year period aggregating $301 million  related to an R&D arrangement. We recorded the estimated net present value of $240 million  as a liability and an intangible asset in 
Developed technology rights  as of the approval date. In June 2018, we en tered into a transaction with the obligee to buyout the remaining liability forthe fixed annual payments for a lump sum payment of 
$224 million . As a result of the buyout transaction, the liability was extinguished and we recognized a non-cash$17 million
 pre-tax gain in Other (income)/deductions––net  in the second quarter of 2018 (see Note 4 ). Bosulif (bosutinib)
In December 2017, the FDA approved Bosulif for the treatment of pa
tients with newly-diagnosed chronic-phase Ph+ CML. In connection with the U.S. approval, we incurred anobligation to make guaranteed fixed annual payments over a 
ten -year period aggregating $416 million  related to an R&D arrangement. We recorded the estimated net present value of 
$364 million  as of the approval date as an intangible asset in Developed technology rights . In August 2018, we entered into a transaction with the obligee to buyout aportion of the remaining liability for the fixed annual payments for a lump sum payment of 
$71 million . As a result of the buyout transaction, the liability was reduced and werecognized a non-cash 
$9 million  pre-tax gain in Other (income)/deductions––net  in the third quarter of 2018 .  The present value of the remaining future payments as ofDecember 31, 2019
 is $191 million, of which $22 million  is recorded in Other current liabilities  and $169 million  is recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities . Besponsa (inotuzumab ozogamicin)
In August 2017, the FDA approved Besponsa and in June
 2017, the EU approved Besponsa as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In connection with the U.S. approval, we incurred an obligation to make guaranteed fixed annual payments over a 
nine -year period aggregating 
$296 million  related to an R&D arrangement. We recorded the estimated net present value of $248 million  as of the approval date as an intangible asset in 
Developed technology rights . The present value of the remaining future payments as of December 31, 2019  is $242 million, of which $7 million  is recorded in Other current liabilities
 and $235 million  is recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities . In connection with the EU approval, we incurred an obligation to make guaranteed fixed annual payments over a 
nine -year period aggregating $148 million  related to an R&D arrangement. We recorded the estimated net present value of $123 million  as of the approval date as an intangible asset in 
Developed technology rights . The present value of the remaining future payments as of December 31, 2019  is $122 million, of which $3 million  is recorded in 
Other current liabilities  and $119 million  is recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities . As of 
December 31, 2019  and 2018 , the differences between the estimated fair values, using a market approach in the Level 2  fair value hierarchy, and carrying values ofthese obligations were not significant.
F
. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesForeign Exchange Risk
A significant portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in 
foreign exchange rates. We manage our foreign exchange risk,in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency
liabilities. We also manage our foreign exchange risk, depending on market conditions, through fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedging programs through the use of
derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. These financial instruments serve to protect net income against the impact of remeasurement into another currency,
or against the impact of translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominated transactions.
All derivative financial instruments used to manage foreign currency risk are measured at fair value and are reported as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge or offset exposures in the 
euro, U.K. pound, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi and Swedish krona . Changes in fair value are reported in earnings or in 
Other comprehensive income/(loss) , depending on the nature and purpose of the financial instrument (hedge or offset  relationship) and theeffectiveness of the hedge relationships, as follows:
•
Generally, we recognize the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts that are designated as fair value hedges in earnings upon the recognition of the change in fairvalue of the hedged risk. For certain foreign exchange contracts, we exclude an amount from the assessment
 of hedge effectiveness and recognize that excluded amountthrough an amortization approach. We also recognize the offsetting foreign exchange impact attributable to the
 hedged item in earnings.•
Generally, we record in Other comprehensive income/(loss)  gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges and reclassify those amounts, as appropriate, into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. For certain foreign exchange contracts, we
exclude an amount from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize that
 excluded amount through an amortization approach.•
We record in Other comprehensive income/(loss)  the foreign exchange gains and losses related to foreign exchange-denominated debt and foreign exchange contracts designated as a hedge of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and reclassify those amounts into earnings upon the sale or substan
tial liquidation of our netinvestments. For foreign exchange contracts, we exclude an amount from the assessment of hedge
 effectiveness and recognize that excluded amount through anamortization approach.
•
For certain foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments, we recognize the gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts that are used tooffset the same foreign currency assets or liabilities immediately into earnings along with the earnings impact of the items they generally offset. These contracts essen
tiallytake the opposite currency position of that reflected in the month-end balance sheet
 to counterbalance the effect of any currency movement.100

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
As a part of our cash flow hedging program, we designate foreign exchange contracts to hedge a
 portion of our forecasted euro, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar, U.K. pound and Australian dollar
-denominated intercompany inventory sales expected to occur no more than two years  from the date of each hedge. For 2017, any ineffectiveness was recognized immediately into earnings. There was no significant ineffectiveness for 2017.
Interest Rate Risk
Our interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. With respect to our investments, we strive to maintain a predominantly floating-rate basis
position, but our strategy may change based on prevailing market conditions. We currently borrow primarily on a long-term, fixed-rate basis. From time to time, depending on
market conditions, we will change the profile of our outstanding debt by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps. We entered into derivative
financial instruments to hedge or offset the fixed interest rates on the
 hedged item, matching the amount and timing of the hedged item. The derivative financial instrumentsprimarily hedge U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt.
All derivative contracts used to manage interest rate risk are measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in fair
value are reported in earnings, as follows:
•
We recognize the gains and losses on interest rate contracts that are designated as fair value hedges in earnings upon the recognition of the change in fair value of thehedged risk. We also recognize the offsetting earnings impact of fixed-rate debt attributable to 
the hedged risk in earnings.For 2017, any ineffectiveness was recognized immediately into earnings. There was no significant ineffectiveness for 2017.

 Carrying amounts exclude the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments.Certain of our derivative financial instruments are covered by associated credit-support agreements that have credit-risk-related contingent features designed to reduce both
counterparties’ exposure to risk of defaulting on amounts owed by the other party. As o
f December 31, 2019 , the aggregate fair value of these derivative financial instruments that are in a net liability position was 
$449 million , for which we have posted collateral of $470 million  in the normal course of business. If there had been a downgrade to below an A rating by S&P or the equivalent rating by Moody’s, we would not have been
 required to post any additional collateral to our counterparties.As of 
December 31, 2019 , we received cash collateral of $835 million  from various counterparties. The collateral primarily supports the approximate fair value of our derivative contracts. With respect to the collateral received, the obligations are reported in 
Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt. G. Credit Risk
On an ongoing basis, we review the creditworthiness of counterparties to our foreign exchange and interest rate agreements and do not
 expect to incur a significant loss fromfailure of any counterparties to perform under the agreements. There are no significant concentrations of credit risk related to our financial instruments with any individual
counterparty. For additional information about concentrations of credit risk related to certain significant customers, see 
Note 17C . As of December 31, 2019 , we had amounts due from a well-diversified, high quality group of banks (
$1.4 billion ) from around the world. For details about our investments, see Note 7B above . In general, there is no requirement for collateral from customers. However, derivative financial instruments are executed under credit-support agreements that provide for the
ability to request to receive cash collateral, depending on levels of exposure, our credit rating and the credit rating of the coun
terparty, see Note 7F  above. Note 8. Inventories

Developed Technology Rights
Developed technology rights represent the amortized cost associated with developed technology, which has been acquired from third parties and which can include the right to
develop, use, market, sell and/or offer for sale the product, compounds and intellectual property that
 we have acquired with respect to products, compounds and/or processesthat have been completed. We possess a well-diversified portfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing the commercialized
products included in our biopharmaceutical businesses. The more significant components of developed technology rights are the following (in order of significance): Xtandi,
Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Infant, Braftovi/Mektovi, Eucrisa, Premarin, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Adult
, and, to a lesser extent Tygacil, Zavicefta, Pristiq, Refacto AF and Bosulif.Also included in this category are the post-approval milestone payments made under our alliance agreements for certain biopharmaceutical products.
Brands
Brands represent the amortized or unamortized cost associated with tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive patent protec
tion. The moresignificant components of indefinite-lived brands are the following (in order of significance): Xanax, Medrol and Depo-Medrol. The more significant components of finite-lived
brands are the following (in order of significance): Depo-Provera and Zavedos.
IPR&D
IPR&D assets represent R&D assets that have not yet
 received regulatory approval in a major market. The significant components of IPR&D at December 31, 2019  include IPR&D assets acquired in connection with the Array acquisition and the program for the oral PARP inhibitor for the treatment
 of patients with germline BRCA-mutatedadvanced breast cancer acquired as part of the Medivation acquisition. IPR&D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or
the abandonment of the associated R&D effort. Accordingly, during the development period af
ter the date of acquisition, these assets will not be amortized until approval isobtained in a major market, typically either the U.S. or the EU, or in a series of other countries, subject
 to certain specified conditions and management judgment. At that time,we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the asset out of 
IPR&D and begin amortization. If the associated R&D effort is abandoned, the related IPR&D assets willlikely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.
For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure is significant and there can be no certainty 
that these assets ultimately will yield successful products. The nature of the biopharmaceuticalbusiness is high-risk and, as such, we expect that many of these IPR&D asse
ts will become impaired and be written off at some time in the future.Licensing Agreements
Licensing agreements for developed technology and licensing agreements for technology in development primarily relate to out-licensing arrangements acquired from third
parties, including the Array acquisition. These intangible assets represent the amortized or unamortized cost associated with the license, where Pfizer has acquired the right to
future royalties and/or milestones upon development or commercialization by the licensing partner. A significant component of the licensing arrangements at 
December 31, 2019
 are for out-licensing arrangements with a number of partners for oncology technology in varying stages of development that have not yet  received regulatory approval in amajor market. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, each of these assets
 is classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will not beamortized until approval is obtained in a major market. At that time we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the respective licensing arrangement asset to 
finite-lived intangible asset and begin amortization. If the development effort is abandoned, the related licensing asset will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment
charge.
Amortization
The weighted-average life for each of our total finite-lived intangible assets and the largest component, developed technology rights, is approximately 
9  years. Totalamortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was 
$4.7 billion  in 2019, $5.0 billion in 2018 and $4.8 billion  in 2017. The following table provides the annual amortization expense expected for the years 2020 through 2024:

two  distinct business segments: Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH). At the beginningof our 2019 fiscal year, we reorganized our commercial operations and our businesses have been managed through 
three  different operating segments––Biopharma, Upjohn and through 
July 31, 2019 , Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare business (see Note 17  for further information). Our Consumer Healthcare business was classified as held for sale as of 
December 31, 2018 (see Note 2C  for further information). Additionally, upon closing of the transaction during the third quarter of 2019, we deconsolidated our Consumer Healthcare business and derecognized Consumer Healthcare goodwill.
As a result of the reorganization of our commercial operations, our remaining goodwill was required to be reallocated amongst the then new Biopharma and Upjohn operating
segments by determining the fair value of each reporting unit under our old and new management structure and the portions being transferred. We completed this re-allocation
based on relative fair value in the second quarter of 2019 and have retrospectively presented goodwill according to the new operating structure.

. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution PlansThe majority of our employees worldwide are eligible for retirement benefits provided through defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we
sponsor both IRC-qualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. A qualified plan meets the requirements of certain sections of
the IRC, and, generally, contributions to qualified plans are tax deductible. A qualified plan typically provides benefits to a broad group of
 employees with restrictions ondiscriminating in favor of highly compensated employees with regard to coverage, benefits and contributions. A supplemental (non-qualified) plan provides additional benefits to
certain employees. In addition, we provide medical insurance benefits to certain retirees and their eligible dependents through our postretirement plans.

 In the second quarter of 2017, we settled the remaining obligation associated with the Hospira U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan. We purchased a group annuity contract on behalf of the remaining planparticipants with a third-party insur
ance provider. As a result, we were relieved of the $156 million  net pension benefit obligat ion and recorded a pretax settlement gain of $41 million , partially offset by the recognition of actuarial losses 
and prior service costs upon plan settlement of approximately $30 million  in Other (income)/deductions— net (see Note 3 ). (b)
 Effective January 1, 2018, we froze two  significant defined benefit pension plans to future benefit accruals in the U.S. and U.K. and as a result, service costs for those plans are eliminated. In addition, due to theplan freeze, the average 
amortization period for the U.S. qualified plans and U.S. supplemental (non-qualified) plans was extended to the expected life expectancy of the plan participants, whereas the averageamortization period in prior ye
ars utilized the expected future service period of plan participants.(c)
 We adopted an accounting standard on January 1, 2018 that requires the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than service costs be presented in Other (income)/deduction s––net on the consolidated statements o
f income. For additional information, see Note 4 . 106

(a)  —  2.8 % 2.8 %International pension plans
  1.4 % 2.5 % 2.6 %(a)
 Effective January 1, 2018, we froze the defined benefit plans to future benefit accruals in the U.S. and members’ accrued benefits to that date no longer increase in line with future compensation increases. Therate of compensation increas
e is therefore no longer an assumption used to determine the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost.The assumptions above are used to develop the benefit obligations at fiscal year-end and to develop the
 net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent fiscal year. Therefore, theassumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for each year are established at the end o
f each previous fiscal year, while the assumptions used to determine benefitobligations are established at each fiscal year-end.
The net periodic benefit cost and the benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on at
 least an annual basis. We revise these assumptions basedon an annual evaluation of long-term trends, as well as market conditions that may have an impact on the cost
 of providing retirement benefits.The weighted-average discount rate for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined annually and evaluated and modified to reflect at year-end the
 prevailing market rate of aportfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or better that reflect
 the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. For our internationalplans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA/
Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a yield curveapproach. These rate determinations are made consistent with local requirements. Overall, the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at year-end 
2019  resulted in lower discount rates as compared to the prior year.

 The PBO represents the present value of the benefit obligation earned through the end of the year and factors in future compensation increases. The ABO is similar to the PBO but does not factor in futurecompensation increases. For the U.S. 
qualified and supplemental (non-qualified) pension plans, the benefit obligation is the PBO, which is also equal to the ABO. Effective January 1, 2018, we froze the definedbenefit plans to future be
nefit accruals in the U.S. and members’ accrued benefits to that date no longer increase in line with future compensation increases. The rate of compensation increase is therefore no
longer an assumption used to determine the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost. For the international pension plans, the benefit obligation is the PBO. The ABO for our international pension plans was$10.6 billion
 in 2019 and $9.5 billion  in 2018. For the postretirement plans, the benefit obligation is the ABO.108

Cash and cash equivalents: Level 1 investments may include cash, cash equivalents and foreign currency valued using exchange rates. Level 2 investments may includeshort-term investment funds which are commingled funds priced at a stable NAV by the administrator of the funds.
•
Equity securities: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they aretraded. Level 1 and Level 2 investments may include commingled funds that have a readily determinable fair value based on quoted prices on an exchange or a published
NAV derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities. Level 3 investments may include individual securities that are unlisted, delisted,
suspended, or illiquid and are typically valued using their last available price.
•
Fixed income securities: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which theyare traded. Level 2 investments may include commingled funds that have a readily determinable fair value based on observable prices of the underlying securities. Level 2
investments may include corporate bonds, government and government agency obligations and other fixed income securities valued using bid evaluation pricing models or
quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Level 3 investments may include securities that are valued using alternative pricing sources, such as investment
managers or brokers, which use proprietary pricing models that incorporate unobservable inputs.
•
Other investments: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they aretraded. Level 2 investments may include Insurance contracts which invest in interest bearing cash, U.S. government securities and corporate debt instruments.
Certain investments are authorized to include derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards for managing risks and exposures.

  100 % 100 % 100 %Global plan assets are managed with the objective of generating returns that will enable the plans to meet their future obligations, while seeking to manage ne
t periodic benefitcosts and cash contributions over the long-term. We utilize long-term asset allocation ranges in the management of our plans’ invested assets. Our long-term return
expectations are developed based on a diversified, global investment strategy that takes into account
 historical experience, as well as the impact of portfolio diversification,active portfolio management, and our view of current and future economic and financial market conditions. As market conditions and other factors change
, we may adjust ourtargets accordingly and our asset allocations may vary from the target allocations.
Our long-term asset allocation ranges reflect our asset class return expectations and tolerance for investment risk within the context of 
the respective plans’ long-term benefitobligations. These ranges are supported by analysis that incorporates historical and expected returns by asset class, as well as volatilities and correlations across asset
classes and our liability profile.
Each pension plan is overseen by a local committee or board that is responsible for the overall investment of the pension plan assets. 
In determining investment policies andassociated target allocations, each committee or board considers a wide variety of factors. As such, the
 target asset allocation for each of our international pension plans is seton a standalone basis by the relevant board or committee. The target asset allocation ranges shown for the
 international pension plans seek to reflect the combined targetallocations across all such plans, while also showing the range within which the target allocations for each plan typically falls.
The investment managers of certain separately managed accounts, commingled funds and private equity funds may be permitted to use repurchase agreements and derivative
securities, including U.S. Treasury and equity futures contracts as described in each respective investment management, subscription, partnership or other governing
agreement.
E. Cash Flows
It is our practice to fund amounts for our qualified pension plans that are at least
 sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit laws andlocal tax laws.

 For the U.S. qualified plans, we plan to make a $1.25 billion  voluntary contribution  in the second half of 2020.The above table reflects the total U.S. and international plan benefits projected 
to be paid from the plans or from our general assets under the current actuarial assumptionsused for the calculation of the benefit obligation and, therefore, actual bene
fit payments may differ from projected benefit payments.F. Defined Contribution Plans
We have defined contribution plans in the U.S. and several other countries. For the majority of the
 U.S. defined contribution plans, employees may contribute a portion of theirsalaries and bonuses to the plans, and we match, in cash, a portion of 
the employee contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2011, for newly hired non-union employees, rehiresand transfers to the U.S. or Puerto Rico, we no longer offer a
 defined benefit pension plan and, instead, offer a Retirement Savings Contribution (RSC) in the definedcontribution plan. The RSC is an annual non-contributory employer contribution (that is not dependent upon the participant making a contribution) determined based on each
employee’s eligible compensation, age and years of service. Beginning on January 1, 2018, all non-union employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit plans
transitioned to the RSC in the defined contribution plans. We recorded charges related to the employer contributions to global defined contribution plans of 
$659 million  in 2019
, $622 million in 2018 and $380 million  in 2017. Note 12
. EquityA. Common Stock
We purchase our common stock through privately negotiated transactions or in open market purchases as circumstances and prices warrant. Purchased shares under each of
the share-purchase plans, which are authorized by our Board of Directors, are available for general corporate purposes. On October 23, 2014, we announced that
 the Board ofDirectors had authorized an 
$11 billion  share repurchase program, which was exhausted in the first quarter of 2017. In December 2015, the Board of  Directors authorized anew 
$11 billion  share repurchase program, which was exhausted in the third quarter of 2018. In December 2017, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $10 billion share repurchase program, which was exhausted in the first quarter of 2019. In December 2018, the Board of Directors authorized a new 
$10 billion  share repurchase program to be utilized over time and share repurchases commenced thereunder in the first quarter of 2019.
On 
February 2, 2017, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Citibank to repurchase $5 billion  of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of theagreement, on February 6, 2017, we paid 
$5 billion  to Citibank and received an initial delivery of approximately 126 million  shares of our common stock from Citibank at a price of 
$31.73 per share, which represented, based on the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on  February 2, 2017, approximately 80%  of the notional amount of theaccelerated share repurchase agreement. On May 16, 2017, the accelerated share repurchase agreement with Citibank was completed, which, per the terms of the
agreement, resulted in Citibank owing us a certain number of shares of Pfizer common stock. Pursuant to the agreement’s set
tlement terms, we received an additional 24 million
 shares of our common stock from Citibank on May 19, 2017. The average price paid for all of the shares delivered under the accelerated share repurchase agreement was 
$33.31 per share. The common stock received is included in Treasury Stock . This agreement was entered into pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase authorization.
On 
March 12, 2018, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Citibank to repurchase $4 billion  of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of theagreement, on 
March 14, 2018 , we paid $4 billion  to Citibank and received an initial delivery of approximately 87 million  shares of our common stock from Citibank at a price of $36.61
 per share, which represented, based on the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on March 12, 2018 , approximately 80%  of the notional amount of theaccelerated share repurchase agreement. On September 5, 2018, the accelerated share repurchase agreement with Citibank was completed, which, per the terms of the
agreement, resulted in Citibank owing us a certain number of shares of Pfizer common stock. Pursuant to the agreement’s set
tlement terms, we received an additional 21 million
 shares of our common stock from Citibank on September 7, 2018. The average price paid for all of the shares delivered under the accelerated share repurchase agreement was 
$36.86  per share. The common stock received is included in Treasury stock . This agreement was entered into pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase authorization.
On 
February 7, 2019, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with GS&Co.  to repurchase approximately $6.8 billion  of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on 
February 12, 2019 , we paid approximately $6.8 billion  to GS&Co. and received an initial delivery of approximately 130 million  shares of our common stock from 
GS&Co. , which represented, based on the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on  February 7, 2019, approximately 80%  of the notionalamount of the accelerated share repurchase agreement.

On 
August 1, 2019, the accelerated share repurchase agreement with GS&Co.  was completed, which, per the terms of the agreement, resulted in GS&Co.  owing us a certain number of shares of Pfizer common stock. Pursuant to the agreement’s settlement 
terms, we received an additional 33.5 million  shares of our common stock from GS&Co.  on August 5, 2019
. The average price paid for all of the shares delivered under the accelerated share repurchase agreement was $41.42  per share. The common stock received is included in 
Treasury stock . This agreement was entered into pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Open market purchases totaled 
$2.1 billion  in 2019 and $8.2 billion  in 2018 under our publicly announced share-purchase plans. The following table provides the number of shares of our common stock purchased and the cost of purchases under our publicly announced share purchase plans, including

December 31, 2019 , our remaining share-purchase authorization was approximately 
$5.3 billion  at December 31, 2019. B. Preferred Stock
The Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock (
7,500  shares designated) is held by an employee stock ownership plan (Preferred ESOP) Trust and provides dividends at the rate of 
6.25% , which are accumulated and paid quarterly. The per-share stated value is $40,300  and the preferred stock ranks senior to our common stock as to dividends and liquidation rights. Each share is convertible, at the holder’s option, into 
2,574.87  shares of our common stock with equal voting rights. The conversion option is indexed to our common stock and requires share settlement, and, therefore, is reported at the fair value at 
the date of issuance. We may redeem the preferred stock at any time or upontermination of the Preferred ESOP, at our option, in cash
, in shares of common stock, or a combination of both at a price of $40,300  per share. C. Employee Stock Ownership Plans
We have 
two  employee stock ownership plans (collectively, the ESOPs), the Preferred ESOP and another that holds common stock of the Company (Common ESOP).Allocated shares held by the Common ESOP, including reinvested dividends, are considered outstanding for EPS calculations and the
 eventual conversion of allocatedpreferred shares held by the Preferred ESOP are assumed in the diluted EPS calculation. 
As of December 31, 2019 , the Preferred ESOP held preferred shares convertible into approximately 
1 million  shares of our common stock, and the Common ESOP held approximately 47 million  shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2019 , all shares of preferred and common stock held by the ESOPs have been allocated 
to the Pfizer U.S. defined contribution plan participants. The compensation cost related to the CommonESOP was 
$20 million  in 2019, $19 million in 2018 and $11 million  in 2017. Note 13. Share-Based Payments
Our compensation programs can include share-based payments. The award value is determined by reference to the fair value of share-based awards to similar employees in
competitive survey data or industry peer groups used for compensation purposes; and is allocated between different long-term incentive vehicles, in the form of TSRUs,
PTSRUs, PTUs, RSUs, PPSs, PSAs
 and stock options, as determined by the Compensation Committee.The 2019 Stock Plan (2019 Plan) replaced and superseded the 2014 Plan. The 2019 
Plan provides for 400 million  shares to be authorized for grants, plus any shares remaining available for grant under the 2014 Plan as of April 25, 2019 (the carryforward shares). In addition, the 2019 Plan provides that 
the number of stock options, StockAppreciation Rights (known as TSRUs and PTSRUs), RSUs, or other performance-based awards that may be granted to any one individual during any 36-month period is
limited to 
20 million  shares, and that RSUs, PPSs and P SAs count as three  shares, while TSRUs, PTSRUs and stock options count as one  share, toward the maximum sharesavailable under the 2019 plan. As of 
December 31, 2019 , 518 million shares were available for award. Although not required to do so, we have used authorized and unissued shares and, to
 a lesser extent, treasury stock to satisfy our obligations under these programs.114

Includes expense for PTSRUs, described in Note 13C  below, which is not significant for all y ears presented.The table above excludes total expense due to the modification for share-based awards in connection with our Organizing for Growth initiative. The to
tal expense was notsignificant for 2019 and 2018, the year in which the Organization for Growth Initiative began and is recorded in 
Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3
). Amounts capitalized as part of inventory cost were not significant for any period presented.
B. Total Shareholder Ret
urn UnitsTSRUs are awarded to senior and other key management, and to certain other employees. TSRUs entitle the holders to receive a number of shares o
f our common stock witha value equal to the difference between the defined settlement price and the
 grant price, plus the dividends accumulated during the five -year or seven -year term, if and to the extent the total value is positive. The settlement price is the average closing price of our common stock during the 
20  trading days ending on the fifth or seventh anniversary ofthe grant, as applicable; the grant price is the closing price of our common stock on the date
 of the grant. The TSRUs are automatically settled on the fifth or seventhanniversary of the grant but vest on the third anniversary of the grant,
 after which time there is no longer a substantial risk of forfeiture.Retiree eligible holders (at least age 
55  with at least ten years  of service) can elect to exercise and convert his/her TSRUs, when vested, into PTUs. The  value received uponthe election and conversion is calculated by taking the change in stock price (
20  trading day average ending on the exercise date (Election Price) less the grant price) plusaccumulated dividends from the grant date, times the number of TSRUs exercised. This value is divided by the Election Price to de
termine the number of PTUs. The PTUs willbe entitled to earn Dividend Equivalent Units (DEUs), and the PTUs and DEUs will be settled in our common stock on the TSRUs’ original settlement date (i.e., 
the fifth orseventh anniversary of grant), and will be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the original grant including forfeiture provisions. We measure the value of T
SRU grants asof the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The values determined through this fair value methodology generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
vesting term into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses , and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate. The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation of TSRUs:

E. Portfolio Performance Shares
PPSs are awards granted to select employees which, when vested, entitle the holder to receive, a
t the end of the performance period, a number of shares within a possiblerange of shares of our common stock, including shares resulting from dividend equivalents paid on such shares. For PPSs granted during the period presented, the
 awardsvest after 
three years  of continuous service from the grant date and the number of shares paid, if  any, depends on the achievement of predetermined goals related to Pfizer’slong-term product portfolio during a 
five -year performance period from the year of the grant date. The number of shares that may be earned over the performance periodranges from 
0%  to 200% of the initial award. We measure the value of PPS grants as of the
 grant date using the intrinsic value method, for which we use the closing price of our common stock. The values are amortizedon a straight-line basis over the probable vesting term into 
Cost of sales,  Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or  Research and development expenses, as appropriate, and adjusted each reporting period, as necessary, to reflect changes in the price of Pfizer’s common stock, changes
 in the number of shares that are probable ofbeing earned and changes in management’s assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and/or changes in management’s
assessment of the probable vesting term.

PSAs are awarded to senior and other key management. PSAs vest
 after three  years of continuous service from the grant date. The number of shares paid, if any , includingshares resulting from dividend equivalents, for awards granted in 2015 and later, depends upon the achievement of predetermined goals related to 
two  measures: (i) adjustedoperating income (for performance years through 2018) or adjusted net income (for 2019 and later years, except for the 2017 PSAs) over 
three  one-year periods; and (ii) TSRas compared to the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index (DRG Index) over the 
three -year performance period. The number of shares that are earned over the performance period ranges from 
0%  to 200% of the initial award. We measure the value of PSA grants as of the
 grant date using the intrinsic value method, for which we use the closing price of our common stock. The values are amortizedon a straight-line basis over the probable vesting term into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses , and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate, and adjusted each reporting period, as necessary, to reflect changes in the price of Pfizer’s common stock, changes

 2017 includes the modification for a commitment to pay  1.1 million PSAs to approximately 90  employees, including senior and key management employees, for 1.1 million  PSAs. These shares were paid in the first quarter of 2018.
G. Stock Options
Stock options are awarded to select employees and, when vested, entitle the holder to
 purchase a specified number of shares of our common stock at a price per share equalto the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.
Beginning in 2016, only a limited set of overseas employees received stock option grants. 
No  stock options were awarded to senior and other key management in any periodpresented; however, stock options were awarded to certain other employees. In virtually all instances, stock options granted vest a
fter three years  of continuous service from the grant date and have a contractual term of 
10  years. In most cases, stock options must be held for at least one year  from the grant date before any vesting may occur. In the event of a sale of business or plant closing or restructuring, options held by employees are immediately vested and are exercisable for a period of 
3 months  following the date employment is terminated or through their remaining term, depending on various conditions.
We measure the value of stock option grants as of the grant
 date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The values determined through this fair valuemethodology generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses , and/or Research and development expenses
, as appropriate. The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation of stock options:

Note 15. Insurance
Our insurance coverage reflects market conditions (including cost and availability) existing at the time it is written, and our decision to obtain insurance coverage or to self-
insure varies accordingly. Depending upon the cost and availability of insurance and the nature of the risk involved, the amount of self-insurance may be significant. The cost
and availability of coverage have resulted in self-insuring certain exposures, including product liability.
 If we incur substantial liabilities that are not covered by insurance orsubstantially exceed insurance coverage and that are in excess of existing accruals, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash
 flows or results of operations in theperiod in which the amounts are paid and/or accrued (see 
Note 16 ). Note 16
. Contingencies and Certain CommitmentsWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including tax and legal contingencies. For a discussion of
our tax contingencies, see 
Note 5D.  For a discussion of our legal contingencies, see below. 2019 Financial Report    
 
 119
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
A
. Legal ProceedingsOur legal contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
Patent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. We are the plaintiff in themajority of these actions. An adverse outcome in actions in which we are the plaintiff could result in loss of paten
t protection for a drug, a significant loss of revenues fromthat drug or impairment of the value of associated assets.
•
Product liability and other product-related litigation, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims,among others, often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual,
provable injury and other matters.
•
Commercial and other matters, which can include merger-related and product-pricing claims and environmental claims and proceedings, can involve complexities that willvary from matter to matter.
•
Government investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S.and in other jurisdictions.
Certain of these contingencies could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, which could be substantial, and/or criminal charges.
We believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We
do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our 
financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise ourexpectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on
 our results of operations in the period in which theamounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.
We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and,
 therefore,determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range o
f reasonably possible loss inexcess of amounts accrued. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that
 have been deemed reasonable by management, but the assessment processrelies heavily on estimates and assumptions that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause
 us tochange those estimates and assumptions.
Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on
estimates and assumptions.
The principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both quantitative and
qualitative factors in order to assess materiality, such as, among other things, the amount of
 damages and the nature of any other relief sought in the proceeding, if suchdamages and other relief are specified; our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength o
f our defenses; whether the action purports to be, or is, a class action and, ifnot certified, our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; whether related actions have been
transferred to multidistrict litigation; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be
important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a reader’s judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information
that is available to the reader; the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation;
 and the extent of public interest in the matter. In addition, with respect to patent mattersin which we are the plaintiff, we consider, among other things, the financial significance of the product protected by
 the patent(s) at issue. As a result of considering qualitativefactors in our determination of principal matters, there are some matters discussed below with respect to which management believes that the likelihood of possible loss in
excess of amounts accrued is remote.
A1
. Legal Proceedings––Patent LitigationLike other pharmaceutical companies, we are involved in numerous suits relating to our patents, including but not limited to, those discussed below. Most of the suits
 involveclaims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products, processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of 
the generic drugmanufacturer. Also, counterclaims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts 
to enforce, patent rights with respect tocertain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. In addition to the
 challenges to the U.S. patents on a number of our products that are discussedbelow, patent rights to certain of our products are being challenged in various other jurisdictions. We are also party to patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to
which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for allegedly causing delay of generic entry. Additionally, our licensing
and collaboration partners face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering products for which we have licenses or co-promotion rights. 
We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the
European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of
 others. Also, if one of our patents is found to  beinvalid by such proceedings, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several
of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio were challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. In October 2017, 
the Patent Trial andAppeal Board (PTAB) refused to initiate proceedings as to 
two  patents. In June 2018, the PTAB ruled on another patent, holding that one  claim was valid and that all otherclaims were invalid. The party challenging that patent has appealed the decision. In November 2019, the U.S. Court of
 Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the PTAB’sruling and requested that the PTAB redecide the challenge.
 In March and June 2019, an additional patent was found invalid in separate proceedings by the PTAB. We haveappealed. Challenges to other patents remain pending in jurisdictions outside the U.S.
 The invalidation of all of the patents in our pneumococcal portfolio could potentially allowa competitor pneumococcal vaccine into the marketplace. In the event that any o
f the patents are found valid and infringed, a competitor pneumococcal vaccine might beprohibited from entering the market or required to pay Pfizer a royalty. We are also subject to patent litigation pursuant to
 which one or more third parties seeks damagesand/or

injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of its patents by our commercial or other activities. For example, our Hospira subsidiaries are involved in patent and
patent-related disputes over their attempts to bring generic pharmaceutical and biosimilar products to market. 
If one of our marketed products is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party may be awarded significant damages, or we may be prevented from further sales of 
that product. Such damages may be enhanced asmuch as three-fold in the event that we or one of our subsidiaries, like Hospira, is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.
Actions In Which We Are 
The PlaintiffEpiPen
In July 2010, King, which we acquired in 2011 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary, brought a patent-infringement action against Sandoz in the U.S. District Court for 
the District ofNew Jersey in connection with Sandoz’s abbreviated new drug application filed with the FDA seeking approval to market an epinephrine injectable product. Sandoz is
challenging patents, which expire in 2025, covering the next-generation autoinjector for use with epinephrine that is sold under the EpiPen brand name.
Precedex Premix
Beginning in 2014, several generic manufacturers filed separate abbreviated new drug applications with the FDA, seeking approval to market their generic versions of our
subsidiary Hospira’s premix version of Precedex prior to the expiration of 
one  or more patents covering the product. One  of those patents expired in March 2019, while othersdo not expire until 2032. Beginning in 2014, Hospira brought suit against these generic manufacturers, in some cases joined by Orion Corporation (co-owner of certain of our
Precedex premix patents). To date, 
two  of the actions have been settled or dismissed on terms not material to Pfizer: (i) the action filed against Ben Venue Laboratories, Inc.,which was sued along with Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC (together, succeeded by Eurohealth International Sarl) and West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp (collectively, the Ben
Venue case); and (ii) the action filed against Baxter Healthcare Corporation. The remaining actions continue as described below.
In August 2015, Hospira filed suit against Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC (Amneal) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware asserting the validity and infringement of
four
 patents relating to the Precedex premix formulations and their use, all of which expire in 2032. In January 2018, the District Court ruled that one  of the four  patents wasvalid and infringed, and that the other 
three  patents were invalid. In February and March 2018, respectively, each of Amneal and Hospira appealed the District Court decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In January 2019, 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision.In December 2015, Fresenius Kabi USA LLC (Fresenius) notified Hospira that it had filed an abbreviated new drug application with the FDA seeking approval to market a
generic version of Hospira’s premix version of Precedex and containing allegations that certain patents relating to the Precedex premix formulations and their use, all of which
expire in 2032, were invalid or not infringed. In January 2016, Hospira filed suit against Fresenius in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, asserting the
validity and infringement of those patents. In December 2018, the District Court ruled that the
 asserted claims of two  patents were invalid. Hospira appealed the District Court’sdecision as to 
one  of the patents to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In January 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the DistrictCourt’s decision.
Separate actions in which Hospira sued Par Sterile Products LLC, Gland Pharma Limited, and Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd., each in response to such generic
manufacturer’s filing of a separate abbreviated new drug application with the FDA, seeking approval to market their generic versions of our subsidiary Hospira’s premix version
of Precedex prior to the expiration of 
one  or more patents covering the product, were stayed pending the outcome of the case against Fresenius described above.Xeljanz (tofacitinib)
Beginning in 2017, we brought patent-infringement actions against several generic manufacturers that filed separate abbreviated new drug applications with the FDA, seeking
approval to market their generic versions of tofacitinib tablets in 
one  or both of 5 mg and 10 mg dosage strengths, and in both immediate and extended release forms. To date,actions against the following generic manufacturers have been settled on terms not material to Pfizer: (i) MicroLabs USA Inc. and MicroLabs Ltd.;
 (ii) Sun PharmaceuticalIndustries Ltd.; (iii) Prinston Pharmaceutical Inc., Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Huahai US Inc. and Solco Healthcare US,
 LLC; and (iv) BreckenridgePharmaceutical Inc., Pensa Pharma S.A. and Laboratorios Del Dr. Esteve, 
S.A. The remaining actions continue as described below.In March 2017, we brought a patent-infringement action against Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. and Cadila Healthcare Ltd. (collectively, Zydus) in the U.S.
 District Court forthe District of Delaware asserting the infringement and validity of 
three  patents: the patent covering the active ingredient expiring in December 2025, the patent  covering anenantiomer of tofacitinib expiring in 2022, and the patent covering a polymorphic form of tofacitinib expiring in 2023, which Zydus challenged in its abbreviated new drug
application seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 5 mg tablets.
In December 2018, we brought a separate patent infringement action against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc
. (Teva) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delawareasserting the infringement and validity of our patent covering extended release formulations of tofacitinib that was challenged by Teva in its abbreviated new drug application
seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 11 mg extended release tablets.
In March 2019, we brought a separate patent infringement action against Ajanta Pharma Ltd
. and Ajanta Pharma USA Inc. (collectively, Ajanta) in the U.S. District Court for theDistrict of Delaware asserting the infringement and validity of 
two  patents: the patent covering the active ingredient that expires in December 2025 and the patent covering apolymorphic form of tofacitinib that expires in 2023, each of which Ajanta challenged in its abbreviated new drug application seeking approval to market a generic version of
tofacitinib 5 mg tablets. In August 2019, in response to
 a similar challenge by Ajanta relating the tofacitinib 10 mg tablets, we brought another patent infringement action againstAjanta in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware.
Inlyta (axitinib)
In April 2018, Apotex Inc. notified us that
 it had filed an abbreviated new drug application with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Inlyta. Apotex Inc.asserts the invalidity and non-infringement of the crystalline form patent for Inlyta that expires in 2030. In
 May2019 Financial Report

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
2018, we filed suit against Apotex Inc. in the U.S
. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the crystalline form patent for Inlyta.In May 2019, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited (Glenmark) notified us that it had filed an abbreviated new drug application with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic
version of Inlyta. Glenmark asserts the invalidity and non-infringement of the crystalline form patent for Inlyta that
 expires in 2030. In June 2019, we filed suit against Glenmarkin the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the crystalline form patent for 
Inlyta.Kerydin (tavaborole)
In September 2018, several generic companies notified us that they had filed abbreviated new drug applications with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of
Kerydin. The generic companies
 assert the invalidity and non-infringement of methods of use and formulation patents for tavaborole that expire in 2026 and 2027, includingpediatric exclusivity. In October 2018, Anacor, our wholly-owned subsidiary
,  filed infringement lawsuits against each of the generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the Districtof Delaware and the U.S. District Court for the District of West Virginia.
Ibrance (palbociclib)
In March 2019, several generic companies notified us that they had filed abbreviated new drug applications with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of
Ibrance. The generic companies assert the invalidity and non-infringement of 
two  composition of matter patents and a method of use patent covering palbociclib, each of whichexpire in 2023. In April 2019, we brought patent infringement actions against each of the
 generic filers in various federal courts, asserting the validity and infringement of thepatents challenged by the generic companies.
Chantix (varenicline)
In January 2020, we brought a patent infringement action against Viwit Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Viwit) in the U.
S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting thevalidity and infringement of 
three  patents challenged by Viwit in its abbreviated new drug application seeking approval to market a generic version of varenicline, 0.5 mg  and 1.0 mg tablets.
Matter Involving Our Collaboration/Licensing Pa
rtnersEliquis
In February, March, and April 2017, 
twenty-five  generic companies sent BMS Paragraph-IV certification letters informing BMS that they had filed abbreviated new drug applications seeking approval of generic versions of Eliquis, challenging the validity and infringement of one or more of the 
three  patents listed in the Orange Book for Eliquis. One
 of the patents expired in December 2019 and the remaining patents currently are set to expire in 2026 and 2031. Eliquis has been jointly developed and is beingcommercialized by BMS and Pfizer. In April 2017, BMS and Pfizer filed patent-infringement actions against all generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the
 District of Delawareand the U.S. District Court for the District of West Virginia, asserting that each
 of the generic companies’ proposed products would infringe each of the patent(s) that eachgeneric filer challenged. Some generic filers challenged only the 2031 patent, some challenged both the 2031 and 2026 patent, and
 one generic company challenged all three patents. We and BMS have settled with certain of 
the generic companies on terms not material to Pfizer, and we and BMS may settle with other generic companies in thefuture.
Action In Which We Are T
he DefendantInflectra (infliximab-dyyb)
In March 2015, Janssen and New York University, together, brought a patent-infringement action in the U.S
. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Hospira,Celltrion Healthcare Co. Ltd. and Celltrion Inc. alleging that infliximab-dyyb, to be marketed by Hospira in the U.S. under the brand name Inflectra, would infringe 
six  patentsrelating to infliximab, its manufacture and use. Claims with respect to 
four  of the patents were dismissed by the plaintiffs, leaving two  patents at issue: the infliximab antibodypatent and a patent relating to cell culture media. In January 2018, the
 antibody patent was declared invalid by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In July 2018, theU.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment and ruled that 
the patent relating to cell culture media was not infringed.Janssen appealed the District Court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
A2. Legal Proceedings––Product Litigation
Like other pharmaceutical companies, we are defendants in numerous cases, including but not limited to those discussed below, related to our pharmaceutical and other
products. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.
Asbestos
Between 1967 and 1982, Warner-Lambert owned American Optical Corporation (American Optical), which manufactured and sold respiratory protective devices and asbestos
safety clothing. In connection with the sale of American Optical in 1982, Warner-Lambert agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities, including certain asbestos-
related and other claims. Claims against American Optical and numerous other defendants are pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged
personal injury from exposure to asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials. Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer in 2000 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.
Warner-Lambert is actively engaged in the defense of, and will continue to explore various means of resolving, these claims.
Numerous lawsuits are pending against Pfizer in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged personal injury from exposure to products allegedly containing
asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials sold by Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries.
There also are a small number of lawsuits pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos in facilities owned or formerly owned
by Pfizer or its subsidiaries.

Effexor
Beginning in May 2011, actions, including purported class actions, were filed in various federal courts against Wyeth and, in certain of the actions,
 affiliates of Wyeth andcertain other defendants relating to Effexor XR, which is the extended-release formulation of Ef
fexor. The plaintiffs in each of the class actions seek to represent a classconsisting of all persons in the U.S. and its territories who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Effexor XR or generic Ef
fexor XRfrom any of the defendants from June 14, 2008 until the
 time the defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct ceased. The plaintiffs in all of the actions allege delay in the launch ofgeneric Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories, in violation of federal antitrust laws and, in certain o
f the actions, the antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws ofcertain states, as the result of Wyeth fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing certain patents for Ef
fexor XR in the Orange Book, enforcing certain patents for Effexor XRand entering into a litigation settlement agreement with a generic drug manufacturer with respect to Effexor XR. Each
 of the plaintiffs seeks treble damages (for itself in theindividual actions or on behalf of the putative class in the purported class actions) for alleged price overcharges for Effexor XR or generic Effexor 
XR in the U.S. and itsterritories since June 14, 2008. All of these actions have been consolidated in the U.S
. District Court for the District of New Jersey.In October 2014, the District Court dismissed the direct purchaser plaintiffs’ claims based on the litigation settlement agreement, but declined to dismiss the o
ther directpurchaser plaintiff claims. In January 2015, the District Court entered partial final judgments as to all settlement agreement claims, including those asserted by direct
purchasers and end-payer plaintiffs, which plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
 Third Circuit. In August 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuitreversed the District Court’s decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.
Lipitor
•
Antitrust ActionsBeginning in November 2011, purported class actions relating to Lipitor were filed in various federal courts against, among others, Pfizer, certain affiliates of Pfizer, and, in
most of the actions, Ranbaxy, Inc. (Ranbaxy) and certain affiliates of Ranbaxy.
 The plaintiffs in these various actions seek to represent nationwide, multi-state or statewideclasses consisting of persons or entities who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic
Lipitor) from any of the defendants from March 2010 until the cessation of the de
fendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct (the Class Period). The plaintiffs allege delay in thelaunch of generic Lipitor, in violation of federal antitrust laws and/or state antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws, resulting from (i) the 2008 agreement pursuant
to which Pfizer and Ranbaxy settled certain patent litigation involving Lipitor, and Pfizer granted Ranbaxy a license to sell a generic version of Lipitor in various markets
beginning on varying dates, and (ii) in certain of the actions, the procurement and/or enforcement of certain patents
 for Lipitor. Each of the actions seeks, among other things,treble damages on behalf of the putative class for alleged price overcharges for Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) during the Class Period. In addition,
individual actions have been filed against Pfizer, Ranbaxy and certain of their affiliates, among others, that assert
 claims and seek relief for the plaintiffs that are substantiallysimilar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above. These various actions have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a
Multi-District Litigation (
In re Lipitor Antitrust Litigation MDL-2332 ) in the U.S. District  Court for the District of New Jersey.In September 2013 and 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims by direct purchasers. In October and November 2014, the District Court dismissed with
prejudice the claims of all other Multi-District Litigation plaintiffs. All plaintiffs have appealed the District Court’s orders dismissing their claims with prejudice to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition, the direct purchaser class plaintiffs appealed the order denying their motion to amend the judgment and 
for leave to amend theircomplaint to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In Augus
t 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the District Court’s decisions and remandedthe claims to the District Court.
Also, in January 2013, the State of West
 Virginia filed an action in West Virginia state court against Pfizer and Ranbaxy, among others, that asserts claims and seeks relief onbehalf of the State of West 
Virginia and residents of that state that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions describedabove.
•
Personal Injury ActionsA number of individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against us in various federal and state courts alleging that the plaintiffs developed type 2 diabetes
 purportedlyas a result of the ingestion of Lipitor. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.
In February 2014, the federal actions were transferred for consolidated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation (
In re Lipitor (Atorvastatin Calcium) Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation (No. II) MDL-2502
) in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. Since 2016, certain cases in the Multi-District Litigationwere remanded to certain state courts. In January 2017, the District Court granted our motion for summary judgment, dismissing substantially all of the remaining cases
pending in the Multi-District Litigation. In January 2017, the plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s decision to the U.S. Court of
 Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In June 2018, theU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision.
Viagra
Since April 2016, a Multi-District Litigation has been pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (
In Re: Viagra (Sildenafil Citrate) Products Liability Litigation, MDL-2691
), in which plaintiffs allege that they developed melanoma and/or the exacerbation of melanoma purportedly as a result of the ingestion of Viagra.Additional cases filed against Lilly with respect to Cialis have also been consolidated in the Multi-District Litigation 
(In re: Viagra (Sildenafil Citrate) and Cialis (Tadalafil) Products Liability Litigation, MDL-2691
). In January 2020, the District Court granted our and Lilly’s motion to exclude all of plaintiffs’ general causation opinions. Intravenous Solutions
Beginning in November 2016, purported class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Hospira, Hospira Worldwide, Inc. and
certain other defendants relating to intravenous saline solution. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of all persons and en
tities in the U.S. who directly purchasedintravenous saline solution sold by any of the defendants from January 1, 2013 until the 
time the defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct ceases. Plaintiffs allege that thedefendants’ conduct restricts output and artificially fixes, raises, maintains and/or stabilizes the prices of intravenous saline solution sold throughout the U.S
. in violation offederal antitrust laws.

Plaintiffs seek treble damages (for themselves and on behalf of the putative classes) and an injunction against de
fendants for alleged price overcharges for intravenous salinesolution in the U.S. since January 1, 2013. All of these ac
tions have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In July 2018, the DistrictCourt granted defendants’ motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint without prejudice. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in September 2018. On
February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our global infusion systems net assets, HIS
, which includes intravenous saline solution, to ICU Medical. The litigation is the subjectof cross-claims for indemnification by both Pfizer and ICU Medical under the purchase agreement.
Hormone Therapy Consumer Class Action
A certified consumer class action is pending against Wyeth in the U.S. District Court for the Sou
thern District of California based on the alleged off-label marketing of itshormone therapy products. The case was originally filed in December 2003. The class consists of California consumers who purchased Wyeth’s hormone-replacement
products between January 1995 and January 2003 and who do not seek personal injury damages therefrom. The class seeks compensatory and punitive damages, including a
full refund of the purchase price.
EpiPen
Beginning in February 2017, purported class actions were filed in various federal courts by indirect purchasers of EpiPen against Pfizer, and/or its affiliates King and Meridian,
and/or various entities affiliated with Mylan, and Mylan Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch. The plaintiffs in these ac
tions seek to represent U.S. nationwide classescomprising persons or entities who paid for any portion of the end-user purchase price of an EpiPen between 2009 until the cessation of
 the defendants’ allegedly unlawfulconduct. In August 2017, a similar lawsuit brought in the U.S. District Court for the
 District of New Jersey on behalf of a purported class of direct purchaser plaintiffs againstPfizer, King, Meridian and Mylan was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. In February 2020, a similar lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas
against Pfizer, King, Meridian and the Mylan entities on behalf of a purported U.S. na
tionwide class of direct purchaser plaintiffs who purchased EpiPen devices directly fromthe defendants (the 2020 lawsuit). Against Pfizer and/or its affiliates, plaintiffs
 in these actions generally allege that Pfizer’s and/or its affiliates’ settlement of patent litigationregarding EpiPen delayed market entry of generic EpiPen in violation of federal antitrust laws and various state antitrust laws. At
 least one  lawsuit also alleges that Pfizerand/or Mylan violated the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Plaintiffs also filed various federal antitrust, sta
te consumer protection and unjustenrichment claims against, and relating to conduct attributable solely to, Mylan and/or its affiliates regarding EpiPen. Plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged overcharges for
EpiPen since 2009. In August 2017, all of these
 actions, except for the 2020 lawsuit, were consolidated for coordinated pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District Litigation (In re: EpiPen (Epinephrine Injection, USP) Marketing, Sales Practices and Antitrust Litigation, MDL-2785
) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas with other EpiPen- related actions against Mylan and/or its affiliates to which Pfizer, King and Meridian are not parties.
Nexium 24HR and Protonix
A number of individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer, certain of its subsidiaries and/or other pharmaceutical manufacturers in various federal and
state courts alleging that the plaintiffs developed kidney-related injuries purportedly as a result of the ingestion of certain proton pump inhibitors. The cases against 
Pfizerinvolve Protonix and/or Nexium 24HR and seek compensatory and punitive damages and, in some cases, treble damages, restitution or disgorgement. In August 2017,
 thefederal actions were ordered transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation (
In re: Proton-Pump Inhibitor Products Liability Litigation  (No. II)) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. On July 31, 2019, we completed the
 transaction in which we and GSK combined our respective consumer healthcarebusinesses into a new consumer healthcare joint venture that operates globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. As part of 
the joint venture transaction, the jointventure has agreed to assume, and to indemnify Pfizer for, liabilities arising out of such litigation to the exten
t related to Nexium 24HR.Docetaxel 
•
Personal Injury ActionsA number of lawsuits have been filed against Hospira and Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs who were treated with Docetaxel developed
permanent hair loss. The significant majority of the cases also name other defendants, including the manufacturer of the branded product
, Taxotere. Plaintiffs seekcompensatory and punitive damages.
In October 2016, the federal cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation (
In re Taxotere (Docetaxel) Products Liability Litigation, MDL-2740
) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. •
Mississippi Attorney General Government InvestigationIn October 2018, the Attorney General of Mississippi filed a complaint in Mississippi state court against the manufacturer of
 the branded product and eight  other manufacturers including Pfizer and Hospira, alleging, with respect to Pfizer and Hospira, a failure to warn about a risk of permanent hair loss in violation of the Mississippi Consumer
Protection Act. The action seeks civil penalties and injunctive relief. 
Array Securities Litigation
In November 2017, 
two  purported class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado alleging that Array, which we acquired in July 2019 and is ourwholly owned subsidiary, and certain of its former officers violated federal securities laws in connection with certain disclosures made, or omitted, by Array regarding the NRAS-
mutant melanoma program. In March 2018, the actions were consolidated into a single proceeding.
Zantac
A number of lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer in various federal courts alleging that plaintiffs developed various types of cancer, or face
 an increased risk of developingcancer, purportedly as a result of the ingestion of Zantac. The significant majority of these
 cases also name other defendants that have historically manufactured and soldZantac. Pfizer has not sold Zantac since 2006. Plaintiffs seek
 compensatory and punitive damages and, in some cases, treble damages, restitution or disgorgement.In February 2020, these federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation (
In re Zantac/Ranitidine NDMA Litigation, MDL-2924 ) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

. Legal Proceedings––Commercial and Other MattersMonsanto-Related Matters
In 1997, Monsanto Company (Former Monsanto) contributed certain chemical manufacturing operations and facilities to a newly formed corporation, Solutia Inc. (Solutia), and
spun off the shares of Solutia. In 2000,
 Former Monsanto merged with Pharmacia & Upjohn Company to form Pharmacia. Pharmacia then transferred its agricultural operationsto a newly created subsidiary, named Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which it spun off in a two-stage process that was completed in 2002. Pharmacia was acquired by
Pfizer in 2003 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.
In connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to
 indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities related to Pharmacia’s formeragricultural business. New Monsanto has defended and/or is defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, the agricultural
business, and has been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.
In connection with its spin-off in 1997, Solutia assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, liabilities related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses. As the result of
its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Solutia’s indemnification obligations relating to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses are primarily limited
to sites that Solutia has owned or operated. In addition, in connec
tion with its spinoff that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmaciafor, any liabilities primarily related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses, including, but not limited to, any such liabilities that Solutia assumed. Solutia’s and New
Monsanto’s assumption of, and agreement to indemnify Pharmacia for, these liabilities apply to pending actions and any future actions related to
 Former Monsanto’s chemicalbusinesses in which Pharmacia is named as a defendant, including, without limitation, actions asserting environmental claims, including alleged exposure to polychlorinated
biphenyls. Solutia and/or New Monsanto are defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, Former Monsanto’s chemical
businesses, and have been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.
Environmental Matters
In 2009, we submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) a corrective measures study report with regard to Pharmacia’s discontinued industrial chemicalfacility in North Haven, Connecticut. In September 2010, our corrective measures study report was approved by the EP
A, and we commenced construction of the site remedyin late 2011 under an Updated Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA. In
 September 2019, the EPA acknowledged that construction of the site remedy has beencompleted.
Also, in 2009, we submitted a revised site-wide feasibility study with regard to Wyeth Holdings Corporation’s (formerly, American Cyanamid Company) discontinued industrial
chemical facility in Bound Brook, New Jersey. In July 2011, Wyeth Holdings Corporation finalized an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent for Removal
Action (the 2011 Administrative Settlement Agreement) with the EPA with regard to 
the Bound Brook facility. In May 2012, we completed construction of an interim remedy toaddress the discharge of impacted groundwater from that facility to the Raritan River. In September 2012, the
 EPA issued a final remediation plan for the Bound Brook facility’smain plant area, which is generally in accordance with one of the remedies evaluated in our revised site-wide feasibility study. In March 2013, Wyeth Holdings Corporation
(now Wyeth Holdings LLC) entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA 
to allow us to undertake detailed engineering design ofthe remedy for the main plant area and to perform a focused feasibility study for 
two  adjacent lagoons. In September 2015, the U.S., on behalf of the EPA, filed a complaint andconsent decree with the federal District Court for the District of New Jersey that allows Wyeth Holdings LLC to complete the design and to
 implement the remedy for the mainplant area. In December 2015, the consent decree (which supersedes the 2011 Administrative Settlement Agreement) was entered by 
the District Court. In September 2018,the EPA issued a final remediation plan for the 
two  adjacent lagoons, which is generally in accordance with one of the remedies evaluated in our focused feasibility study, andin September 2019, Wyeth Holdings LLC entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the
 EPA to allow us to undertake detailedengineering design of the remedy for the lagoons.
We have accrued for the estimated costs of the site remedies for the
 North Haven and Bound Brook facilities.We are a party to a number of other proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as
 amended, and otherstate, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.
Contracts with Iraqi Ministry of Health
In October 2017, a number of United States service members, civilians, and their families brought a complaint in the U.S. District Court for 
the District of Columbia against anumber of pharmaceutical and medical devices companies, including Pfizer and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the defendants violated the United States Anti-
Terrorism Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and medical
device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health, and seeks monetary relief. In July 2018, the U.
S. Department of Justice requested documents related to this matter, which arebeing provided.
Allergan Complaint for Indemnity
In August 2018, Pfizer was named as a defendant in a
 third-party complaint for indemnity, along with King, filed by Allergan Finance LLC (Allergan) in a Multi-District Litigation(
In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation MDL 2804) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The lawsuit asserted claims for indemnity related to Kadian, which was owned for a short period by King in 2008, prior to Pfizer's acquisition of King in 2010. In December 2018, the
 District Court dismissed the lawsuit. In February 2019,Allergan filed a similar complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, asserting claims for indemnity related to Kadian.
Breach of Contract
–– XalkoriPfizer is
 a defendant in a breach of contract action brought by New York University (NYU) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (Supreme Court). NYU alleges that itis
 entitled  to  royalties  on  Pfizer’s  sales  of Xalkori  under  the  terms  of  a  Research  and  License  Agreement  between  NYU  and  Sugen,  Inc.  Sugen,  Inc.  was  acquired  byPharmacia

A4. Legal Proceedings––Government Investigations
Like other pharmaceutical companies, we are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in
which we operate. Criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or
deferred prosecution agreements, as well as reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations in the U.S. and other
jurisdictions in which we do business. In addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil
damages and penalties on behalf of the government.
 Among the investigations by government agencies are the matters discussed below. Phenytoin Sodium Capsules
In 2012, Pfizer sold the U.K. Marketing Authorisation for phenytoin sodium capsules to a
 third party, but retained the right to supply the finished product to that third party. InMay 2013, the U.K. Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) informed us that it had launched an
 investigation into the supply of phenytoin sodium capsules in the U.K. market.In August 2015, the CMA issued a Statement
 of Objections alleging that Pfizer and Pfizer Limited, a U.K. subsidiary, engaged in conduct that violates U.K. and EU antitrustlaws. In December 2016, the CMA imposed a 
£84.2 million  fine on Pfizer and Pfizer Limited. Pfizer appealed the CMA decision to The Competition Appeal Tribunal in February 2017
. On June 7, 2018, the Competition Appeal Tribunal overturned the CMA decision as well as the associated fine. The CMA appealed the judgment to the Court of Appeal.Greenstone Investigations
•
U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division InvestigationSince July 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust
 Division has been investigating our Greenstone generics business. We believe this is related to an ongoing broaderantitrust investigation of the generic pharmaceutical industry. The government has been obtaining information from Greenstone.
•
State Attorneys General Generics Antitrust LitigationIn April 2018, Greenstone received requests for information from the Antitrust Department of the
 Connecticut Office of the Attorney General. In May 2019, Attorneys General ofmore than 40 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico filed a complaint against a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer. The
matter has been consolidated with a Multi-District Litigation (
In re: Generic Pharmaceuticals Pricing Antitrust Litigation MDL No. 2724)  in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. As to Greenstone and Pfizer, the complaint alleges anticompetitive conduct in violation of federal and s
tate antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws.Subpoena relating to Manufacturing of Quillivant XR
In October 2018, we received a subpoena from the U.S. A
ttorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) seeking records relating to our relationship with anotherdrug manufacturer and its production and manufacturing of drugs including, but not limited to, Quillivant XR. We have produced records pursuant to
 the subpoena.Government Inquiries relating to Meridian Medical Technologies
In February 2019, we received a civil investigative demand from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the
 SDNY. The civil investigative demand seeks records and information relatedto alleged quality issues involving the manufacture of auto-injectors at our Meridian site. In August 2019, we received a HIPA
A subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for theEastern District of Missouri seeking similar records and information. We are producing records in response to these requests.
U.S. Department of Justice/SEC Inquiry relating to Russian Operations
In June 2019, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice’s FCPA Unit seeking documents
 relating to our operations in Russia. In September 2019,we received a similar request from the SEC’s FCPA unit. We are producing records pursuant to these requests.

B. Guarantees and Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and
 other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certainliabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If
 the indemnified party were to make asuccessful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions
and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of 
December 31, 2019 , the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations was not significant.
In addition, in connection with our entry into certain agreements, our counterparties agree to indemnify us. For example, our collaboration agreement with EMD Serono, Inc. 
toco-promote Rebif in the U.S. expired at the end of 2015 and included certain indemnity provisions. Patent litigation brought by
 Biogen Idec MA Inc. against EMD Serono Inc.and Pfizer is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and the United S
tates Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. EMD Serono Inc. hasacknowledged that it is obligated to satisfy any award of damages.
Pfizer Inc. has also guaranteed the long-term debt of certain companies that it acquired and 
that now are subsidiaries of Pfizer.126

C. Certain Commitments
•
As of December 31, 2019 , we had agreements totaling $2.5 billion  to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and include amounts relating to advertising, information technology services, employee benefit administration services, and potential milestone payments deemed reasonably likely to occur, as well as
obligations to make guaranteed fixed annual payments over a 
seven -year period in connection with the U.S. and EU approvals for Besponsa ( $412 million ) and an obligation to make guaranteed fixed annual payments over an 
eight -year period for Bosulif ( $217 million ), both associated with R&D arrangements. •
As of December 31, 2019 , in connection with the TCJA, we have an estimated $15 billion  repatriation tax liability on accumulated post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which we elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, payment over eight years through 2026
. With respect to the aforementionedrepatriation tax liability, it is reported in current 
Income taxes payable  (approximately $600 million  due in April 2020) and the remaining liability is reported in noncurrent Other taxes payable 
in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 . The first installment of $750 million  was paid in April 2019. Our obligations may vary as a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards. See 
Note 5A  for additional information. D. Contingent Considerat
ion for AcquisitionsWe may be required to make contingent consideration payments to sellers for certain prior business combinations. See 
Note 1D . The estimated fair value of contingent consideration as of 
December 31, 2019  is $711 million, of which $160 million  is recorded in Other current liabilities  and $551 million  is recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities . The estimated fair value of contingent consideration as of 
December 31, 2018  is $988 million, of which $280 million  is recorded in Other current liabilities  and $708 million  is recorded in 
Other noncurrent liabilities . The decrease in the contingent consideration balance from prior year is primarily due to payments made upon the achievement of certain milestones.
Note 17. 
Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information A. 
Segment InformationWe regularly review our segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Prior to January 1, 2019, we managed our
commercial operations through 
two  distinct business segments: Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH). At the beginning of our fiscal year 2019, wereorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of 
three  distinct business segments: Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group (Biopharma), Upjohn and, through 
July 31, 2019 , Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare business (Consumer Healthcare), each led by a single manager. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities. Upjohn and through 
July 31, 2019 , Consumer Healthcare, are responsible for their own R&D activities while Biopharma receives its R&D services from GPD and WRDM. These services include IPR&D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line
products. Each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the
operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation. Biopharma and Upjohn are the only reportable segments. We have revised
prior-period information (Revenues and Earnings, as defined by management) to conform to the current management structure. As our operations were not managed under the
new structure until the beginning of fiscal 2019, certain costs and expenses could not be directly at
tributed to one of the then new operating segments. As a result, ouroperating segment results for 2018 and 2017 include allocations, which management believes are reasonable. As described in 
Note 1A , acquisitions impacted our results of operations in 
2019  and 2017 , the contribution of our Consumer Healthcare business to the GSK Consumer Healthcare joint venture impacted our results of operations in 2019 and divestitures impacted our results of operations in 
2017 . 2019 Financial Report

Note 1A  and Note 2C  for additional information. Other Costs and Business Activities
Certain pre-tax costs are not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with the
 following:•
WRDM––the R&D and Medical expenses managed by our WRDM organization, which is generally responsible for research projects for our Biopharma portfolio until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the GPD organization for possible clinical and commercial development. R&D spending may include
upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. The WRDM organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services
organizations, which provide end-to-end technical expertise and other services to the various R&D projects, as well as the Worldwide Medical and Safety group, which
ensures that Pfizer provides all stakeholders––including patients, healthcare providers, pharmacists, payers and health authorities––with complete and up-to-date
information on the risks and benefits associated with Pfizer products so that they can
 make appropriate decisions on how and when to use Pfizer’s medicines.•
GPD––the costs associated with our GPD organization, which is generally responsible for clinical trials from WRDM in the Biopharma portfolio, including late stage portfoliospend. GPD also provides technical support and other services to Pfizer R&D projects. GPD is responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with
regulatory agencies.
•
Other––the operating results of our Consumer Healthcare business, through July 31, 2019, and costs associated with other commercial activities not managed as part ofBiopharma or Upjohn, including all strategy, business development, portfolio management and valuation capabilities, which previously had been reported in various parts of
the organization.
•
Corporate and Other Unallocated––the costs associated with platform functions (such as worldwide technology, global real estate operations, legal, finance, humanresources, worldwide public affairs, compliance, and worldwide procurement), patient advocacy activities and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as
interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments, as well as overhead expenses associated with our manufacturing (which include manufacturing
variances associated with production) and commercial operations that are not directly assessed to an operating segment, as business unit (segment) management does not
manage these costs.
•
Certain transactions and events such as (i) purchase accounting adjustments, where we incur expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments toinventory, intangible assets and PP&E; (ii) acquisition-related costs, where we incur costs for executing the transaction, integrating the
 acquired operations and restructuringthe combined company; and (iii) certain significant items, representing substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items (such as gains on the completion of
joint venture transactions, restructuring charges, legal charges or net gains and losses on investments in equity securities) that are evaluated on an individual basis by
management and that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expec
ted to occur as part of our normal business on a regular128

basis. Such items can include, but are not limited to, non-acquisition-related restructuring costs, as well as costs incurred for legal settlements, asset impairments and
disposals of assets or businesses, including, as applicable, any associated transition activities.
Segment Assets
We manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as
 many of our operating assets are shared or commingled (such as accounts receivable, asmany of our customers are served by multiple operating segments). Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating
segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were approximately 
$167 billion  as of December 31, 2019  and approximately $159 billion
 as of December 31, 2018 . Selected Income Statement Information
