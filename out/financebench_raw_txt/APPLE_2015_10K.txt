The
 Company’s customers are primarily  in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells itsproducts
 and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers and small and mid-sized businesses  through its retail and onlinestores
 and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers,retailers

et sales.The
 Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of thehardware
 and  software  integration  and  demonstrate  the  unique  solutions  that  are  available  on  its  products.  The  Company  further  believes  providing  directcontact
 with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products  over those of its competitors and providing a high-qualitysales and after-sales su
pport experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers.To
 ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to build and improve itsdistribution
 capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. The Company’s retail stores are typically located at high-traffic locations inquality
 shopping  malls  and  urban  shopping  districts.  By  operating  its  own stores  and  locating  them  in  desirable  high-traffic  locations  the  Company  is  betterpositioned

Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 4

ested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high-quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources withinselected third-party reseller locations. Through

 their performance, productivity, ease of use and seamless integration into information technology environments.
 The Company’s products are compatible with thousands of third-party business applications and services, and its tools enable the developmentand secure deployment of custom appl
ications as well as remote device administration. No single customer accounted fo
r more than 10% of net sales in 2015, 2014 or 2013.Competition
The
 markets  for  the  Company’s  products  and services  are  highly  competitive  and  the  Company  is  confronted  by  aggressive  competition  in  all  areas  of  itsbusiness.
 These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and
 use of  mobile communication  and media devices,  personal computers  and other digital electronic devices. The Company’s competitors  that sell mobiledevices
 and personal computers based on other operating systems have  aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain marketshare.
 The  Company’s  financial  condition  and  operating  results  can  be  adversely  affected  by  these  and  other  industry-wide  downward  pressures  on  grossmargins.
 Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features (including security features), relative price and performance,product
 quality  and  reliability, design  innovation,  a  strong  third-party  software  and accessories  ecosystem,  marketing and distribution capability, service andsupport and corporate reputation.
The Company is focused
 on expanding its market opportunities related to per sonal computers and mobile communication and media devices. These markets arehighly
 competitive  and  include  many  large,  well-funded  and  experienced  participants.  The  Company  expects  competition  in  these  markets  to intensify significantly
 as  competitors  attempt  to  imitate  some  of  the  features  of  the  Company’s  products  and  applications  within  their  own  products  or,  alternatively,collaborate
 with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those  they currently offer. These markets are characterized by aggressive pricingpractices,
 frequent  product  introductions,  evolving  design  approaches  and  technologies,  rapid  adoption  of  technological  and  product  advancements  bycompetitors and 
price sensitivit y on the part of consumers and businesses.The
 Company’s digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies  promoting their own digital music and content products andservices, including those of
fering free peer-to-peer music and video services.The
 Company’s future financial condition and operating results depend on the Company’s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services
 in each of the markets in which it competes. The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including thehardware
 (iOS devices,  Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV), software  (iOS, OS X, watchOS  and tvOS), online services and distribution of digital content andapplications (Internet
 Services). Some of the Company’s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such productsand 
services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Company’s offerings.Supply of Components
Although
 most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently obtained from
 single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication andmedia
 devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company,  including those that are available from multiple sources, are attimes
 subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operatingresults.
 
Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 5

Table of ContentsThe
 Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and the Company often utilizes  custom components availablefrom
 only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured ormanufacturing
 capacity has increased. If the Company’s  supply of components were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments ofcompleted
 products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  The Company’s businessand financial performance could
 also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or toidentify
 and obtain sufficient quantities from an  alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected ifthose suppliers concentrated on the product
ion of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The
 Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew
 these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases thatcould materially adversely affec
t its financial condition and operating results. While
 some  Mac computers  are  manufactured  in  the  U.S.  and  Ireland,  substantially  all of  the  Company’s  hardware  products  are  currently manufactured  byoutsourcing
 partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcingpartners,
 often  in  single  locations.  Certain  of  these  outsourcing partners  are  the  sole-sourced  suppliers  of  components  and  manufacturers  for  many  of  theCompany’s
 products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company’s operating results could be adversely
 affected  if  its  outsourcing  partners  were  unable  to  meet  their  production  commitments.  The  Company’s  purchase  commitments  typically  cover  itsrequirements for periods up to 150 days.
Research and Development
Because
 the  industries  in  which  the Company  competes  are  characterized  by  rapid  technological  advances,  the  Company’s  ability  to  compete  successfullydepends
 heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace.  The Companycontinues
 to  develop  new  technologies  to  enhance  existing  products  and  to  expand  the  range  of  its  product  offerings  through  R&D, licensing  of  intellectualproperty
 and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.  Total R&D expense was $8.1 billion, $6.0 billion and $4.5 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013,respectively.
Patents, Trademarks, Cop
yrights and Licenses The
 Company  currently  holds  rights  to  patents  and  copyrights  relating  to  certain  aspects  of  its  hardware  devices,  accessories,  software and  services. TheCompany
 has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although the Company believes theownership
 of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important  factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on suchownership, the Company r
elies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.The
 Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent
 applications  around  the  world.  Over  time,  the  Company  has  accumulated  a  large  portfolio  of  issued  patents  around  the  world.  The  Company  holdscopyrights
 relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single  patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products. TheCompany believes the duration of 
its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.Many
 of the Company’s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or  renewlicenses relating to various as
pects of its products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commerciallyreasonable
 terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained  in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of technologicalchanges
 in the industries in which the Company competes, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible thatcertain 
components  of the Company’s products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. Fromtime to time, the Company has been notif
ied that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual proper ty rights of third parties.Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic 
DataDuring
 2015, the Company’s domestic and international net sales accounted for 35% and 65%, respectively, of total net sales.  Information regarding financialdata by
 geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading “Segment Operating Performance,” and in Part II, Item 8 of thisForm 
10-K in the Notes to Consolidated F inancial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.”

Table of ContentsWhile
 some  Mac  computers  are  manufactured  in  the  U.S.  and  Ireland,  substantially  all  of  the  Company’s hardware  products  are  currently manufactured  byoutsourcing
 partners  that  are  located  primarily  in  Asia.  The  supply  and  manufacture  of  a  number  of  components  is  performed  by  sole-sourced  outsourcingpartners
 in the U.S.,  Asia and Europe.  Margins  on sales  of the  Company’s products  in foreign countries  and on sales of products  that include componentsobtained
 from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and
 antidumping penalties. Information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of thisForm 
10-K in the Notes to Consolida ted Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies.”Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The
 Company  has  historically  experienced  higher  net  sales  in  its  first  quarter  compared  to  other  quarters  in  its  fiscal  year  due  in  part  to  seasonal holiday demand.
 Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impactthe
 Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels  are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often,channel
 inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers anddistributors
 anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be consideredreliable indicator
s of the Company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or  financial performance.Warranty
The 
Company  offers  a  limited  parts  and  labor  warranty  on  most  of  its  hardware  products.  The  basic  warranty  period  is  typically  one  year  from  the  date  ofpurchase
 by the original end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic  warranty for its service parts used to repair the Company’s hardware products. Incertain
 jurisdictions, local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by  statute, typically at least two years. In addition,where available, consumers may
 purchase APP or AC+, which extends service coverage on many of the Company’s hardware products.Backlog
In
 the Company’s experience, the actual amount of product  backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. Inparticular, backlog often
 increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once customers believe they
 can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company’s ability to achieve anyparticular level of revenue
 or financial performance.Employees
As of September 26, 2015, the Company had 
approximately 110,000  full-time equivalent employees.Available Information

 Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant toSections 13(a) and

Risk Factors The
 following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors  may be important to understanding other statements in this Form10-K.
 The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated finan
cial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.The
 business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but
 not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual financial condition and operatingresults
 to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition  and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materiallyand adversely affect
 the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.Because of the
 following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable 
indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely af
fect the Company.The
 Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions
 poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility,government
 austerity  programs,  negative  financial  news,  declines  in  income  or asset  values  and/or  other  factors.  These  worldwide  and  regional  economicconditions
 could have a material adverse effect on demand for the Company’s products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Company’sexpectations 
as  a result of currency fluctuations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to correspond withthe
 effect of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Other factors that could influence worldwide or regional  demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs,conditions
 in  the  real  estate  and  mortgage  markets,  unemployment,  labor  and  healthcare  costs,  access  to  credit,  consumer  confidence  and  othermacroeconomic
 factors affecting consumer spending  behavior. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Company’sproducts and services.
In
 the event  of  financial  turmoil  affecting  the  banking  system  and  financial  markets,  additional  consolidation  of  the  financial  services  industry,  or  significantfinancial
 service institution failures, there could be tightening in the credit  markets, low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equitymarkets.
 This could have a number of effects on the Company’s business, including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing  partners or suppliers ortheir
 inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners,to
 obtain  credit  to  finance  purchases of  the  Company’s  products;  failure  of  derivative  counterparties  and  other  financial  institutions;  and  restrictions  on  theCompany’s
 ability to issue new debt. Other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending  on gains or losses realized on the saleor
 exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; changes in interestrates; increases or 
decreases in  cash balances; volatility in foreign exchange rates; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. Increased volatility in thefinancial
 markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts  realized in the future on the Company’s financial instrumentsdiffering significantly from th
e fair values currently assigned to them.Global markets for the Company’s products and
 services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.
The
 Company’s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets  characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressureon
 gross  margins,  frequent  introduction  of  new  products,  short  product  life  cycles,  evolving  industry  standards,  continual  improvement  in  productprice/performance 
characteristics, rap id adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.The 
Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, servicesand
 technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs  and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including thehardware,
 operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. TheCompany 
currently  holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks andservice
 marks.  In  contrast,  many  of  the  Company’s  competitors  seek  to  compete  primarily  through aggressive  pricing  and  very  low  cost  structures,  andemulating
 the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new productswith 
attractive  margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could beadversely affected.

Table of ContentsThe
 Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the iOS mobile operating system and  also markets related third-party digitalcontent
 and applications. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distributionand
 other resources, as well as established hardware,  software and digital content supplier relationships; and the Company has a minority market share in theglobal
 smartphone market. Additionally, the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt  to imitate theCompany’s
 product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitivethan
 those they currently offer. The Company competes with business  models that include content provided to users for free. The Company also competes withillegitimate
 ways  to  obtain  third-party  digital  content  and  applications.  Some  of  the  Company’s  competitors  have  greater  experience,  product  breadth and distribution
 channels  than  the  Company.  Because  some  current  and  potential  competitors  have  substantial  resources  and/or  experience  and  a  lower  coststructure,
 they  may  be  able  to  provide  products  and  services  at  little  or  no  profit  or  even  at  a loss.  The  Company  also  expects  competition  to  intensify  ascompetitors
 attempt  to  imitate  the  Company’s  approach  to  providing  components  seamlessly  within  their  individual  offerings  or  work  collaboratively  to  offerintegrated
 solutions. The Company’s  financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve iOS and iOSdevices in order to mainta
in their functional and design advantages.The
 Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using OS X, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. This market has beencontracting
 and  is  dominated  by  computer  makers  using  competing  operating  systems,  most  notably  Windows.  In  the  market  for  personal  computers  andaccessories,
 the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines,  lower priced products and a larger installedcustomer base.
 Historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors sellingWindows-based
 personal computers have  aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. An increasing number of internet-enabled devices that includesoftware
 applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company’s  existing products. TheCompany’s
 financial  condition  and  operating  results  also  depend  on  its  ability  to  continually  improve  the  Mac  platform  to  maintain  its  functional  and  designadvantages.
There can be no assurance the Company w
ill be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.To remain competitive and stimulate custo
mer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.Due
 to the highly volatile and competitive nature  of the industries in which the Company competes,  the Company must continually introduce  new products, services
 and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfullymanage
 the transition to these new and upgraded products. The success of new product introductions  depends on a number of factors including, but not limitedto,
 timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-upissues, the 
availability  of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipatedproduct demand, the availabil
ity of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that ne w products may havequality
 or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of newproduct introductions and 
transitions. The Company depends on the performance of dis
tributors, carriers and other resellers.The
 Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers and value-added resellers, many of whom distribute
 products  from  competing  manufacturers.  The  Company  also  sells  its  products  and  third-party  products  in  most  of  its  major  markets  directly  toeducation, enterprise and government custo
mers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its online and retail stores.Carriers
 providing  cellular  network  service  for  iPhone  typically  subsidize  users’  purchases  of the  device.  There  is  no  assurance  that  such  subsidies  will  becontinued
 at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with newcarriers.
 
Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 9

Table of ContentsMany
 resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions.  Some resellers have perceived theexpansion
 of the Company’s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Company’s products. Such a perceptioncould
 discourage resellers from investing  resources in the distribution and sale of the Company’s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of thoseproducts. The Company has invested and 
will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ st ores with Companyemployees
 and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance ofreturn
 or  incremental  revenue.  The financial  condition  of  these  resellers  could  weaken,  these  resellers  could  stop  distributing  the  Company’s  products,  oruncertainty
 regarding  demand  for  some  or  all  of  the  Company’s  products  could  cause  resellers  to  reduce  their  ordering and  marketing  of  the  Company’sproducts.
The Company faces substantial inventory and other asse
t risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The
 Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated  demand or net realizable valueand
 accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets, includingcapital
 assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and  inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of anasset may not be recoverable. If the
 Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of
 the assets exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assetsand
 purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given  that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid andunpredictable pace of product obsoles
cence in the industries in which the Company competes.The
 Company  must  order  components  for  its  products  and  build  inventory  in  advance  of  product  announcements  and  shipments.  Consistent  with  industrypractice,
 components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders, in each case based on projecteddemand.
 Where  appropriate,  the  purchases  are  applied  to  inventory  component prepayments  that  are  outstanding  with  the  respective  supplier.  Purchasecommitments
 typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile,competitive
 and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficientamounts of components or products, or not ful
ly utilize firm purchase commitments.Future operating results depend upon the Co
mpany’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities.Because
 the  Company  currently  obtains  components  from  single  or  limited  sources,  the  Company  is  subject  to  significant  supply  and  pricing  risks.  Manycomponents,
 including  those  that  are  available  from  multiple  sources,  are  at  times  subject  to  industry-wide  shortages  and  significant  commodity  pricingfluctuations.
 While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there  can be no assurance that the Company will be able toextend
 or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. A number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead tobusiness
 failure for the supplier  or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components.The
 effects  of  global  or  regional  economic  conditions  on  the  Company’s  suppliers,  described in  “ Global
and
regional
economic
conditions
could
materiallyadversely
affect
the
Company”
above, also could affect the Company ’s ability to obtain components .
 Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risksof supply shortages 
and price increases.The Company
 and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete  for various componentswith
 other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the restof
 these industries. The Company’s new products  often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses newtechnologies,
 initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued  availability ofthese components at
 acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the productionof common
 components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s  requirements. The supply of components for a new or existing product couldbe delayed or constrained, or a key manufa
cturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company.

Table of ContentsThe
 Company  depends  on  component  and  product  manufacturing  and  logistical  services  provided  by outsourcing  partners,  many  of  which  arelocated outside of the U.S.
Substantially all of
 the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or  in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. The Company has alsooutsourced
 much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control
 over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or theCompany’s
 flexibility  to  respond  to  changing  conditions.  Although arrangements  with  these  partners  may  contain  provisions  for  warranty  expensereimbursement,
 the  Company  may  remain  responsible  to  the  consumer  for  warranty  service  in  the  event  of  product  defects  and  could  experience  anunanticipated
 product defect or  warranty liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of thesupplier code of cond
uct could occur.The
 Company  relies  on  sole-sourced  outsourcing  partners  in  the  U.S.,  Asia  and  Europe  to  supply  and  manufacture  many  critical  components,  and  onoutsourcing partners primarily located in
 Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to performmay
 have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or  finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations ortransit to final destinations may be disrupted for a
 variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology systemfailures, commercial disputes, military ac
tions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.The
 Company has invested  in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments tocertain
 of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply  of components and finished goods, ifthese
 outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced orterminated and th
e net realizable value of these assets could b e negatively impacted.The
 Company’s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that  can result in decreased sales and operating marginand harm to the Company
’s reputation.The
 Company sells complex hardware and software  products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating systemsoftware
 and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the software’s  intended operation. TheCompany’s
 online services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. Defects may also occur in components and products theCompany purchases
 from third parties. There can be no  assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and servicesit sells. Failure to do 
so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the Company’s reputation.The Company relies on access to third-par
ty digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The
 Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content. This includes the right to sell currently available  music, movies, TV shows andbooks.
 The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal ofthese arrangements on reasonable terms, 
if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in  the future may offer competing products andservices,
 and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content  in the future. Other contentowners,
 providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue tooffer
 a wide variety of content at reasonable prices  with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to makeavailable
 third-party  digital  content,  or  to  make  available  such  content  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  could  have  a  material adverse  impact  on  theCompany’s financial condition an
d operating results.Some
 third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide  digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, theCompany may have to
 develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license suchsolutions
 at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force theCompany
 to  license  its  digital  rights  management,  which  could  lessen  the  protection  of content  and  subject  it  to  piracy  and  also  could  negatively  affectarrangements with the
 Company’s content providers.

Table of ContentsThe Company’s future perfor
mance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The
 Company  believes  decisions  by customers  to  purchase  its hardware products  depend  in part on the availability  of third-party software  applications andservices. There
 is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s pr oducts.If
 third-party  software  applications  and  services  cease  to  be  developed  and  maintained  for  the  Company’s  products,  customers  may  choose  not  to  buy  theCompany’s products.
With
 respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of third-party software  applications and services  depends in part on the developers’perception
 and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software for the Company’s products compared to Windows-based
 products. This analysis may be based on  factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may begenerated,
 expected  future  growth  of  Mac  sales  and  the  costs  of  developing  such  applications  and  services.  If  the  Company’s  minority share  of  the  globalpersonal
 computer  market  causes  developers  to  question  the  Mac’s  prospects,  developers  could  be  less  inclined  to  develop  or  upgrade  software  for  theCompany’s Mac products an
d more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market.With
 respect to iOS devices, the Company relies on the continued availability and development  of compelling and innovative software applications, which aredistributed
 through a single distribution channel, the App Store. iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unableto
 or choose not  to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. As withapplications for
 the Company’s Mac products, the availability and development of these applications also  depend on developers’ perceptions and analysis of therelative
 benefits  of  developing,  maintaining  or  upgrading  software  for  the  Company’s  iOS  devices  rather  than  its  competitors’  platforms,  such  as  Android.  Ifdevelopers focus their efforts on these 
competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s iOS devices may suffer.The
 Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
Many of the Company’s
 products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industrypractice,
 the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses canbe
 obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure  to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commerciallyreasonable
 terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s  financial conditionand operating results.
The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results o
f legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights.The
 Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have  not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business,and additional claims may arise in
 the future.For 
example, technology companies, including many of the Company’s competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement orother violations of
 intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to  monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As theCompany has
 grown, the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company’s cellular enabledproducts 
compete with products  from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the number of patent claimsagainst
 the Company has significantly increased. The Company is vigorously defending infringement  actions in courts in a number of  U.S. jurisdictions andbefore
 the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions andsubstantial 
damages. Regardless
 of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual  litigants, the Companymay
 have to engage in protracted litigation. If the Company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether itcan

ohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products.In
 certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on 
acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase the Company’s operating expenses.

Table of ContentsRegardless
 of  the  merit  of  particular  claims,  litigation  may  be  expensive,  time-consuming,  disruptive  to  the Company’s  operations  and  distracting  tomanagement. In recognition of these conside
rations, the Company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation.In management’s opinion, there is not at 
least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently
uncertain.
Although management
 considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period
 for  amounts  in  excess  of  management’s  expectations,  the  Company’s  consolidated  financial  statements  for  that  reporting  period  could  be  materiallyadversely
 affected.  Further,  such  an  outcome  could  result  in  significant compensatory,  punitive  or  trebled  monetary  damages,  disgorgement  of  revenue  orprofits, remedial corporat
e measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.The
 Company  is  subject  to  laws  and  regulations  worldwide,  changes  to  which  could  increase  the  Company’s  costs  and  individually  or  in the aggregate adversely affect the Company’s business.
The
 Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting  its domestic and international  operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws andregulations
 affect the Company’s activities including, but not limited to, in areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e- commerce,
 promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement,tax,
 import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and  cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition,environmental, health and safety.
By
 way of example, laws and regulations  related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates areextensive
 and  subject  to  change.  Such  changes  could  include,  among  others,  restrictions  on  the  production,  manufacture, distribution  and  use  of  devices,locking
 devices to a carrier’s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier’s network. These devices are also subject to certification andregulation
 by  governmental  and  standardization bodies,  as  well  as  by  cellular  network  carriers  for  use  on  their  networks.  These  certification  processes  areextensive
 and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could preclude the Company from selling cer
tain products.Compliance
 with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and  expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,further
 increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulationsor in 
their interpretation,  could individually or in the aggregate make the Company’s products and services less attractive to the Company’s customers, delay theintroduction
 of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or  limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policiesand
 procedures  designed  to  ensure  compliance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  but  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  Company’s  employees,contractors, or age
nts will not violate such laws and regula tions or the Company’s policies and procedures.The Company’s business is subject to the risks of 
international operations. The
 Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with  applicable U.S. and foreign laws andregulations,
 such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacyrequirements,
 environmental  laws,  labor  laws and  anti-competition  regulations,  increases  the  costs  of  doing  business  in  foreign  jurisdictions.  Although  theCompany
 has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company’s employees, contractors, or agents could
 nevertheless  occur.  Violations  of  these  laws  and  regulations  could  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company’s  brand,  international  growth  efforts  andbusiness.
The
 Company  also  could  be  significantly  affected  by  other  risks  associated  with  international  activities  including,  but  not  limited  to,  economic  and labor conditions,
 increased duties, taxes and other costs and political instability. Margins on sales of the Company’s products in foreign countries, and on sales ofproducts
 that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially  adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties,tariffs
 and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain internationalmarkets. There can 
be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.

Table of ContentsThe
 Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment  and commitment of resources and are subject tonumerous risks and uncertainties.
The Company’s retail stores 
have required substantial investment in equ ipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. TheCompany
 also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve  as high-profilevenues
 to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations andsize,
 these  stores  require  substantially  more  investment  than  the Company’s  more  typical  retail  stores.  Due  to  the  high  cost  structure  associated  with  theCompany’s
 retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment
 and leasehold improvements and severance costs.Many
 factors unique to retail operations, some of which are  beyond the Company’s control, pose risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include,but
 are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the Company’s inability  to manage costsassociated
 with store construction and operation, the Company’s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners, more challenging environmentsin
 managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs associated  with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and the Company’s inability toobtain and renew leas
es in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.Investment
 in  new  business  strategies  and  acquisitions  could  disrupt  the  Company’s  ongoing  business  and  present  risks  not  originallycontemplated.
The
 Company  has  invested,  and  in  the  future  may  invest,  in  new  business  strategies  or  acquisitions.  Such  endeavors  may  involve significant  risks  anduncertainties,
 including  distraction  of  management  from  current  operations,  greater  than  expected  liabilities  and  expenses,  inadequate  return  of  capital  andunidentified issues not di
scovered in the Company’s due diligence. These new ventures a re inherently risky and may not be successful.The Company’s business and reputation may be 
impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.The
 Company may be subject to information technology system failures  and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, powerdisruptions,
 telecommunications  failures,  acts  of  terrorism  or  war,  computer  viruses,  physical  or  electronic  break-ins,  or  other  events  or  disruptions. System redundancy
 may  be  ineffective  or  inadequate,  and  the  Company’s  disaster  recovery  planning  may  not  be  sufficient  for  all  eventualities.  Such  failures  ordisruptions
 could, among other things, prevent access to the Company’s online stores  and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise Company orcustomer
 data,  and  result  in  delayed  or  cancelled  orders.  System  failures  and  disruptions  could  also  impede  the  manufacturing  and  shipping  of  products,delivery of online 
services, transactions processin g and financial reporting.There
 may  be  breaches  of  the  Company’s  information  technology  systems that  materially  damage  business  partner  and  customer  relationships,curtail
 or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, or subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal andoperational consequences.
The
 Company’s business requires it to use and store customer, employee and business partner personally identifiable information (“PII”).  This may include,among
 other  information,  names,  addresses,  phone  numbers,  email  addresses,  contact  preferences,  tax  identification  numbers  and  payment  accountinformation.
 Although malicious attacks to gain access to PII affect many  companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk ofbeing targeted because of its high profi
le and the amount of PII it manages.The Company requires user names and pa
sswords in order to access its information technology systems. The Company also uses encryption and authenticationtechnologies
 designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Company data or accounts. As with all companies, these securitymeasures
 are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password  management, or other irregularities. For example, thirdparties
 may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn beused
 to access the Company’s  information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors accounts and systems forunusual activity and may free
ze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders.  
Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 14

Table of ContentsThe
 Company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to  protect its systems and data, but these securitymeasures
 cannot provide absolute security. To the extent the Company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data,such
 a breach could materially damage business  partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores andservices.
 Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Company’s systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII, the  Company’s reputation andbrand
 could  be  materially  damaged,  use  of  the  Company’s  products  and  services  could  decrease,  and  the  Company  could  be  exposed  to  a  risk of  loss  orlitigation
 and possible liability. While the Company maintains insurance  coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self-insured retention, is designed
 to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continu
ally evolving area of cyber risk.The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. 
and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations rega rding data protection.The
 Company is subject to federal, state and international  laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these lawsapply
 not  only  to  third-party  transactions,  but  also  to  transfers  of  information  between  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries,  and among  the  Company,  itssubsidiaries
 and other parties with which the Company has commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions areconsidering
 imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to  develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emergingand
 changing  international  requirements  may  cause  the  Company  to  incur  substantial  costs  or  require  the  Company  to  change  its  business  practices.Noncompliance could result in p
enalties or significant legal liability.The Company’s
 privacy policy, which includes related practices concerning the  use and disclosure of data, is posted on its website. Any failure by the Company,its
 suppliers or other parties with whom the Company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal, state or international privacy- related or data protection laws and 
regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others.The
 Company  is  also  subject  to  payment  card  association  rules  and  obligations  under  its  contracts  with  payment  card  processors.  Under  these  rules  andobligations,
 if  information  is  compromised,  the  Company  could  be  liable  to  payment  card  issuers  for  associated  expenses  and  penalties.  In  addition,  if  theCompany
 fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information  is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines orexperience a significant incre
ase in payment card transaction costs.The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key pe
rsonnel.Much
 of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and
 other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especiallyin Silicon Valley, where most of t
he Company’s key personnel are located. The
 Company’s  business  may  be  impacted  by  political  events,  war,  terrorism,  public  health  issues,  natural  disasters  and other  businessinterruptions.
War,
 terrorism,  geopolitical  uncertainties,  public  health  issues  and  other  business  interruptions  have  caused and  could  cause  damage  or  disruption  tointernational commerce and
 the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturingvendors and customers, includ
ing channel partners. The Company’s business operations are  subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, whetheras
 a result of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts,  labor disputes, publichealth
 issues  and  other  events  beyond  its  control.  Such  events  could  decrease  demand  for  the  Company’s  products,  make  it  difficult  or  impossible  for  theCompany
 to  make  and  deliver  products  to  its  customers, including  channel  partners,  or  to  receive  components  from  its  suppliers,  and  create  delays  andinefficiencies
 in the Company’s supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent
 employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delaysin
 production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Company’s  manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of theCompany’s
 R&D  activities,  its  corporate  headquarters,  information  technology  systems  and  other  critical  business  operations,  including  certain  componentsuppliers
 and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, the Company could incursignificant losses, require subs
tantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations.

Table of ContentsThe Company expects its quarterly revenue and ope
rating results to fluctuate.The
 Company’s  profit  margins  vary  across  its  products  and  distribution  channels.  The  Company’s  software,  accessories,  and  service  and  support contracts generally
 have higher gross margins than certain of the Company’s other products. Gross margins on the Company’s hardware products vary across productlines
 and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration  changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. TheCompany’s
 direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Company’s grossmargin
 and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic orchannel
 mix, component cost increases, the strengthening U.S. dollar, price competition, or  the introduction of new products, including those that have highercost structures with flat 
or reduced pricing.The Company has typically 
experienced higher net  sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, newproduct introductions can significantly impact net sales, product
 costs and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a majority of its net sales from asingle
 product  and  a  decline  in  demand  for  that  product  could  significantly  impact  quarterly  net  sales.  The  Company  could  also  be  subject  to  unexpecteddevelopments
 late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated  demand for the Company’s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systemsfailure, or failure of one of the Co
mpany’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility.
The
 Company’s  stock  price  has  experienced  substantial  price  volatility  in  the  past  and  may  continue  to  do  so  in  the  future.  Additionally,  the Company,  thetechnology
 industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways thatmay
 have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility  over a given period may cause the average price at which the Companyrepurchases
 its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growthand
 profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that itscurrent
 share  repurchase  program  will  be  fully  consummated.  Future  dividends  are subject  to  declaration  by  the  Company’s  Board  of  Directors,  and  theCompany’s
 share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to futuregrowth, 
profitability,  dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverseimpact on investor confidence and e
mployee retention.The Company’s financial performance is subject 
to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies. The
 Company’s  primary  exposure  to  movements  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  relates  to  non-U.S.  dollar-denominated  sales and  operating expensesworldwide.
 Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency-denominatedsales
 and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international  pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. Margins on salesof
 the Company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected
 by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise localprices to
 fully offset the dollar’s strengthening, or at all, which would  adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency-denominated salesand
 earnings.  Conversely,  a  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar,  while  generally  beneficial  to  the  Company’s foreign  currency-denominated
 sales  and  earnings,  could  cause  the  Company  to  reduce  international  pricing  and  incur  losses  on  its  foreign  currency  derivative  instruments,thereby limiting the benefit. 
Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase  the Company’s cost of product components denominated in thosecurrencies, thus adversely 
affecting gross margins.The Company 
uses  derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currencyexchange
 rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse  financial effects of unfavorable movements inforeign exchange rates over the li
mited time the hedges are in place.The Company 
is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the ma rket values of its investment portfolio.Given
 the global nature of its business, the Company  has both domestic and international investments. Credit ratings and pricing of the Company’s investmentscan be
 negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors.  As a result, the value andliquidity
 of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized anysignificant losses on its cash,
 cash equivalents and market able securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss.

Table of ContentsThe
 Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables  and prepayments related to long-term supplyagreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when econo
mic conditions worsen.The
 Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. The Company also sells its products
 directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstandingtrade
 receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements  or credit insurance. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectability riskon
 its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade
 receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble finalproducts
 for  the  Company.  In  addition,  the  Company  has  made  prepayments  associated  with long-term  supply  agreements  to  secure  supply  of  inventorycomponents.
 As  of  September  26,  2015,  a  significant  portion  of  the  Company’s  trade  receivables  was  concentrated  within  cellular  network  carriers,  and  itsvendor
 non-trade receivables  and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily inAsia.
 While  the  Company  has  procedures  to  monitor  and  limit  exposure  to  credit  risk  on  its  trade  and  vendor non-trade  receivables,  as  well  as  long-termprepayments, there
 can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.The
 Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation  or exposure to additional  taxliabilities.
The Company
 is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized.Due
 to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates could beaffected by changes in the mix of 
earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in  the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changesin
 tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. For example, in June 2014, the European Commission  opened a formal investigation ofIreland to
 examine whether decisions by the tax authorities with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the Company’s Irish subsidiaries complywith European Union rules o
n state aid. If the  European Commission were to conclude against Ireland, it could require Ireland to recover from the Company pasttaxes covering a period of up to 10 years 
reflective of the disallowed state aid, and such amount could be material.The
 Company  is  also  subject  to  the  examination  of  its  tax  returns  and  other  tax  matters  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  and  other  tax  authorities  andgovernmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these
 examinations to determine the adequacy of itsprovision for taxes. There can be
 no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in theU.S. or
 Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s financialcondition, operating r
esults and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Legal Proceedings The
 Company is subject to the legal proceedings and claims discussed below as well  as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fullyresolved
 and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Companymay

 the  outcome  of  legal proceedings  and  claims brought  against  the  Company  is subject  to  significant uncertainty.  Therefore, although managementconsiders

Antitrust Litigation (United States of America v. Apple Inc., et al.)On
 April 11, 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust  action against the Company and five major book publishers in the U.S. District Court forthe Southern District of New York, alleging an unreasonable restraint of interstate trade and
 commerce in violation of §1 of the Sherman Act and seeking, among other
 things, injunctive relief, the District Court’s declaration that the Company’s agency agreements with the publishers are null and void and/or the DistrictCourt’s
 reformation of such agreements. On July 10, 2013,  the District Court found,  following a bench trial, that the Company conspired  to restrain trade inviolation
 of §1 of the Sherman Act and relevant state statutes to the extent those laws are congruent with §1 of the Sherman Act.  The District Court entered apermanent
 injunction, which took effect on October 6, 2013 and will be in effect for five years unless the judgment is overturned on appeal. The Company hastaken
 the  necessary  steps  to  comply  with  the terms  of  the  District  Court’s  order,  including  renegotiating  agreements  with  the  five  major  eBook  publishers,updating its antitrust train
ing program and completing a two-year monitorship with a court-appointed antitrust compliance monitor, whose appointment t he DistrictCourt ended in October 2015. The Company appealed the 
District Court’s decision. Pursuant to a settlement agreement reached in June 2014, any damages theCompany may be obligated to pay w

 Company sells its products worldwide through

 In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party  Apple compatible products, including application software and various accessories through itsonline and retail stores. The

2015
Highlights
Net
 sales rose 28% or $50.9 billion  during 2015 compared to 2014, driven by a 52% year-over-year increase in iPhone ® net sales. iPhone net sales and unitsales
 in 2015 increased in all of the Company’s reportable operating  segments. The Company also experienced year-over-year net sales increases in Mac ® ,Services
 and Other Products. Apple Watch ® , which launched during the third quarter of 2015, accounted for more than 100% of the year-over-year growth innet
 sales of Other Products. Net sales growth during 2015 was partially offset by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to  the U.S. dollar andlower
 iPad ® net sales. Total net sales increased in each of the Company’s reportable operating segments, with particularly strong growth in Greater Chinawhere year-over-year net
 sales increased 84%.In April 2015, the Company announced a s
ignificant increase to its capital return program by raising the expected total size of the program to $200 bi llion throughMarch
 2017. This included increasing its share repurchase authorization to $140 billion and raising its quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share beginning in May2015.
 During 2015, the Company  spent $36.0 billion to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $11.6 billion.Additionally,
 the Company issued $14.5 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated, €  4.8 billion of euro-denominated, SFr1.3 billion of Swiss franc-denominated, £1.3billion of British pound-denomin
ated, A$2.3 billion of Australian dollar-denominated and ¥250.0 billion of Japanese yen-denominated term debt during 2015. Fiscal
2014
Highlights
Net
 sales rose 7% or $11.9 billion during 2014 compared to 2013. This was driven by increases in net sales of iPhone, Mac and Services. Net sales and unitsales
 increased for iPhone primarily due to the successful introduction of iPhone 5s and 5c in the latter half of calendar year 2013, the successful launch ofiPhone
 6 and 6 Plus beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, and expanded distribution. Mac  net sales and unit sales increased primarily due to strong demandfor
 MacBook Air ® and MacBook Pro ® which were updated in 2014 with faster  processors and offered at lower prices. Net sales of Services grew primarily dueto increased
 revenue from sales through the App Store ® , AppleCare ® and licensing. Growth in these areas was partially offset by the year-over-year decline innet sales
 for iPad due to lower unit sales in many markets, and a decline in net sales of Other Products. All of  the Company’s operating segments other than theRest of Asia Pacifi
c segment experienced increased net sales in 2014, with growth being strongest in the Greater China and Japan operating segments.During 2014,
 the Company completed various business acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Beats Music, LLC, which offers a subscription streaming music service, and Beats Electro
nics, LLC, which makes Beats ® headphones, speakers and audio software.

 year-over-year growth in iPhone net sales and unit sales during 2015 primarily resulted from strong demand for iPhone 6  and 6 Plus during 2015. Overallaverage
 selling  prices  (“ASPs”)  for  iPhone  increased  by  11%  during  2015  compared  to  2014,  due  primarily  to  the  introduction  of  iPhone  6  and  6  Plus  inSeptember 2014, partially offset by the effe
ct of weakness in most foreign c urrencies relative to the U.S. dollar.The
 year-over-year growth in iPhone net sales and unit sales in 2014 resulted primarily  from the successful introduction of new iPhones in the latter half ofcalendar
 year 2013, the successful launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus beginning in September 2014, and expanded distribution. iPhone unit sales grew in all of theCompany’s
 operating segments, while iPhone net sales grew in all segments except Rest of Asia Pacific. Overall ASPs for iPhone were relatively flat in 2014compared
 to  2013,  with  growth  in  ASPs  in  the  Americas  segment  being  offset  by  a  decline in  ASPs  in  the  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacificsegments.

 sales and unit sales for iPad declined during 2015 compared to 2014. The Company believes the decline in iPad sales is  due in part to a longer repurchasecycle
 for iPads and some level of cannibalization from the Company’s other products. iPad ASPs declined by 5% during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as aresult of the effect of weakness in mo
st foreign currencies relative to the  U.S. dollar and a shift in mix to lower-priced iPads.Net
 sales and unit sales for iPad declined in 2014 compared to 2013.  iPad net sales and unit sales grew in the Greater China and Japan segments but thisgrowth
 was more than offset by a decline in all other segments. Overall iPad ASPs were relatively flat in 2014 compared to 2013 with a shift in mix to higher- priced
 iPads being offset by the October 2013 price reduction of iPad mini™. ASPs increased in the Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific segments but were slightlydown in other segments.

 increase in net sales of Services during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to growth from Internet Services and licensing. The  App Store, includedwithin Internet Service
s, generated strong year-over-year net sales growth of 29%.The
 increase in net sales of Services  in 2014  compared  to  2013  was primarily due  to  growth  in  net  sales from  Internet  Services,  AppleCare  and  licensing.Internet
 Services generated a total of $10.2 billion in net sales during 2014 compared to $9.3 billion during 2013. Growth in net  sales from Internet Services wasdriven
 by increases in revenue from app sales reflecting continued growth in the installed base of iOS devices and the expanded offerings of iOS apps andrelated in-app purchases. This 
was partially offset by a decline in sales of digital music. Segment Operating Performance
The
 Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,
 Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, aswell
 as  India,  the  Middle  East  and  Africa.  The  Greater  China  segment  includes  China,  Hong Kong  and  Taiwan.  The  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific  segment  includesAustralia
 and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable operating segments. Although, each reportable operating segment providessimilar
 hardware and software products  and similar services, they are managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers anddistribution
 partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s  reportable operating segmentscan be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K

 growth in the Europe segment in 2014 was due to increased net sales of iPhone, Mac and Services, as well as strength in European currencies relative to the
 U.S. dollar, partially offset by a decline in net sales of iPad. iPhone growth resulted primarily from the successful introduction of iPhone 5s and 5c in thesecond
 half of calendar 2013 and the successful launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in over  20 countries in Europe in September 2014. Mac growth was drivenprimarily by increased net sales

 Greater China segment experienced year-over-year growth in net sales in 2014 that was significantly higher than the growth rate for the Company overall. Greater
 China growth was driven by higher unit sales and net sales of all major product categories, in addition to higher net sales of Services. Growth in netsales
 and unit sales of iPhone was especially strong, driven by the successful launch  of iPhone 5s and 5c in Mainland China and Hong Kong in September2013,
 the successful launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in Hong Kong in September 2014, increased demand for the Company’s entry-priced iPhones and theaddition of a significant

   Gross margin percentage
   40.1%      38.6%      37.6%   The
 year-over-year increase in the gross margin percentage in 2015 was driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix to products  with higher margins and, to alesser
 extent, by improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. These positive factors were partially offset primarily by higher product cost structuresand, to a lesser extent, by the effect of 
weakness in most foreign c urrencies relative to the U.S. dollar.The
 year-over-year increase in the gross margin percentage in 2014 was driven by multiple  factors including lower commodity costs, a favorable shift in mix toproducts
 with  higher  margins  and  improved  leverage  on  fixed  costs  from  higher  net  sales,  which  was  partially  offset  by  the  weakness  in  several  foreigncurrencies relative 
to the U.S. dollar, price redu ctions on select products and higher cost structures on certain new products.The
 Company  anticipates  gross  margin during  the  first  quarter  of  2016  to  be  between  39%  and  40%.  The  foregoing  statement  regarding  the  Company’sexpected gross margin percentage in the first
 quarter of 2016 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company’s future gross mar gins can beimpacted
 by  multiple  factors  including,  but  not  limited  to,  those  set  forth  in  Part  I,  Item  1A  of  this  Form  10-K  under  the  heading  “Risk  Factors”  and  thosedescribed
 in  this  paragraph.  In general,  the  Company  believes  gross  margins  will  remain  under  downward  pressure  due  to  a  variety  of  factors,  includingcontinued
 industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions,  potential increases in thecost
 of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potentialshift
 in the Company’s sales mix towards products  with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to takeproduct
 pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company’s ability  to manage product qualityand
 warranty  costs  effectively  and  to  stimulate  demand  for  certain  of  its  products.  Due  to  the  Company’s  significant  international  operations,  its  financialcondition and opera
ting results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.Operating Expenses

     The
 increase in other income/(expense), net during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to higher interest income, partially  offset by higher expensesassociated
 with foreign exchange activity and higher interest expense on debt. The decrease in other income and expense during 2014 compared to 2013 wasdue
 primarily  to  higher  interest  expense  on  debt  and  higher expenses  associated  with  foreign  exchange  rate  movements,  partially  offset  by  lower  premiumexpenses
 on foreign exchange contracts and higher interest income. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalentsand

 Company’s effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due  primarily to certain undistributed foreignearnings,
 a  substantial  portion  of  which  was  generated  by  subsidiaries  organized  in  Ireland,  for  which  no  U.S.  taxes  are  provided  when  such  earnings  areintended to
 be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.  The higher effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to higher foreign taxes. Theeffective tax rate in 2014 compared to 2013 wa
s relatively flat.As
 of September 26, 2015, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses and tax credits of $7.8 billion  anddeferred tax
 liabilities of $24.1 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a resultof certain tax planning strategie
s, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary  differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets.The Company will cont
inue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance. The
 U.S. Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the years 2010 through 2012, and all years prior to 2010 are closed. In addition,  the Company issubject
 to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain openand
 could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.  Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that mayresult
 from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax  audits areresolved
 in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period suchresolution occurs.
On
 June 11, 2014, the European Commission issued an opening decision initiating a formal investigation against Ireland for alleged state aid to the Company. The
 opening decision concerns the allocation of profits for taxation purposes of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company. The Company believesthe
 European  Commission’s  assertions  are  without  merit.  If  the  European Commission  were  to  conclude  against  Ireland,  the  European  Commission  couldrequire
 Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid. While such amount could bematerial, as of 
September 26, 2015 the Company is unable to est imate the impact.

 (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles thatgovern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entit
y expects to be entitled when products are transfer red to customers.The
 original effective date for ASU 2014-09 would have required the Company to adopt beginning  in its first quarter of 2018. In August 2015, the FASB issuedASU
 No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) – Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for oneyear
 and permits  early adoption as early as the original effective date of ASU 2014-09. Accordingly, the Company may adopt the standard in either its firstquarter
 of 2018 or 2019. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented  or retrospectively with the cumulative effectrecognized as of the

 U.S. income taxation  on repatriation to the U.S. The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities andits
 investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy  requires investments generally to be investment grade with theobjective of minimizing the po
tential risk of principal loss.During

 practice,  the  Company  acquires  components  through  a  combination  of  purchase  orders,  supplier  contracts,  and  open  orders  based  on  projecteddemand information. Where 
appropriate, the  purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. As ofSeptember
 26, 2015, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing  commitments and component purchase commitments of $29.5billion.
Other
Obligations
The
 Company’s  other  off-balance  sheet  obligations  were  comprised  of  commitments  to  acquire  capital  assets,  including  product  tooling  and manufacturing process
 equipment,  and  commitments  related  to  inventory  prepayments,  advertising,  licensing,  R&D,  internet  and  telecommunications  services,  energy  andother obligations.
The
 Company’s other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the
 related  gross interest  and penalties.  As of  September  26,  2015,  the  Company had  non-current  deferred  tax liabilities of $24.1  billion. Additionally,  as ofSeptember 26,
 2015, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of  $6.9 billion and an additional $1.3 billion for gross interest and penalties classified asnon-current liabilities. At
 this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilit
ies; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.Indemnification
The Company
 generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual
 property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could besubject
 to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company  or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, therewas
 not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system orapplication 
software  for  infringement  of  third-party  intellectual  property  rights.  The  Company  did  not  record  a  liability  for  infringement  costs  related  toindemnification as of Septembe
r 26, 2015 or September 27, 2014.

Table of ContentsIn September 2015, the Company introduced the i
Phone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase an iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in one of itsU.S. physical retail stores and
 activate the purchased iPhone with one of the four national carriers. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right totrade
 in that iPhone for a new iPhone, provided  certain conditions are met. One of the conditions of this program requires the customer to finance the initialpurchase
 price of the iPhone with a third-party lender. Upon exercise of the trade-in right and purchase of a new iPhone, the Company  satisfies the customer’soutstanding
 balance due to the third-party lender on the original device. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizesarrangement revenue net of the fair value of such 
right with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.The
 Company  has  entered  into  indemnification  agreements  with  its directors  and  executive  officers.  Under  these  agreements,  the  Company  has  agreed  toindemnify
 such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advanceexpenses
 incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of paymentsthe
 Company  could  be  required  to  make  under  these  agreements  due  to  the  limited  history  of prior  indemnification  claims  and  the  unique  facts  andcircumstances
 involved  in  each  claim.  However,  the  Company  maintains  directors  and  officers  liability  insurance  coverage  to  reduce  its  exposure  to  suchobligations.
Critical Accounting Po
licies and EstimatesThe
 preparation of financial  statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’sdiscussion
 and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s  management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates thataffect the
 amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notesto 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of theCompany’s
 consolidated  financial  statements.  Management  bases  its  estimates  on historical  experience  and  on various other assumptions  it believes to bereasonable
 under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual resultsmay differ from 
these estimates, and such differences may be material.Management believes t
he Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, va luation and impairment of marketablesecurities,
 inventory  valuation  and  valuation  of  manufacturing-related  assets  and  estimated  purchase  commitment  cancellation  fees,  warranty  costs,  incometaxes,
 and  legal  and other  contingencies.  Management  considers  these  policies  critical  because  they  are  both  important  to  the  portrayal  of  the  Company’sfinancial
 condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently  uncertain matters. The Company’ssenior
 management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board ofDirectors.
Revenue
Recognition
Net
 sales consist primarily of revenue from  the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. TheCompany
 recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and c ollectionis probable. Product
 is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. Formost
 of the Company’s product  sales, these criteria are  met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to educationcustomers
 in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of
 the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as paymentsbecome
 due  unless  the  Company  has  positive  evidence  that  the  sales  price is  fixed  or  determinable,  such  as  a  successful  history  of  collection,  withoutconcession,
 on  comparable  arrangements.  The  Company  recognizes  revenue  from  the  sale  of  hardware  products,  software  bundled  with  hardware  that  isessential
 to the functionality  of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accountingguidance.
 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance  for the following types of sales transactions:(i)
 standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of thehardware.
For
 multi-element  arrangements  that  include  hardware  products  containing  software  essential  to  the  hardware  product’s  functionality, undelivered  softwareelements
 that relate to the hardware product’s essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverablesbased
 on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the  Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue todeliverables:
 (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”)  and (iii) best estimate of selling price(“ESP”).
 VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable.ESPs reflect the 
Company’s best estimates o f what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.

Table of ContentsFor
 sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may  from time to time provide future unspecifiedsoftware
 upgrades to the device’s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for theunspecified
 software upgrade rights or the non-software  services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company’s ESPs. Revenueallocated
 to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Company’s ESPs is deferred and recognized  on a straight-linebasis over the estimated period the 
software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.The 
Company’s  process for determining ESPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon theunique
 facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances  change, the Company’s ESPs and the future rate of relatedamortization
 for  unspecified  software  upgrades  and  non-software  services related  to  future  sales  of  these  devices  could  change.  Factors  subject  to  changeinclude the 
unspecified  software upgrade rights and non-software services offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non-softwareservices and the estimated per
iod unspecified software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. The
 Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs.  For transactionsinvolving
 price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably andreliably
 estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have  been met. The Company’s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated,revenue
 is  not  recognized  until  reliable  estimates  can  be  made  or  the  price  protection  lapses.  For  the  Company’s  other  customer  incentive  programs, the estimated
 cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company alsorecords
 reductions  to  revenue  for  expected  future  product  returns  based  on  the Company’s  historical  experience.  Future  market  conditions  and  producttransitions
 may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customerincentive 
programs  require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management’s estimates are based onhistorical
 experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater  than estimated proportion of customers redeems suchincentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have
 an adverse impact on the Company’s operating results.Valuation
and
Impairmen
t
of
Marketable
SecuritiesThe 
Company’s  investments  in  available-for-sale  securities  are  reported  at  fair  value.  Unrealized  gains  and  losses  related  to  changes  in  the  fair  value  ofsecurities
 are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Company’s  Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value ofavailable-for-sale securit
ies impact the Company’s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realizedgains
 and losses  on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investmentportfolio to determine
 if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to  record an impairment charge in the period any suchdetermination is
 made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is lessthan its cost; 
the  financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required tosell,
 the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company’s assessment on  whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could changein
 the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the Company’soperating 
results. Inventory

Cancellation
FeesThe
 Company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing-related assets, includingcapital
 assets  held  at  its  suppliers’  facilities.  In  addition,  the  Company  has  made  prepayments  to  certain  of  its  suppliers  associated  with  long-term  supplyagreements
 to secure supply of inventory components. The Company records a write-down for  inventories of components and products, including third-partyproducts
 held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed reviewof inventory that considers 
multiple factors including  demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and componentcost
 trends. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment  whenever events or circumstancesindicate
 the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment lossequal to the amount by which the carry
ing value of such an asset exceeds its fair value.The industries in
 which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. In certain
 circumstances the Company may be required to record additional write-downs of inventory and/or manufacturing-related assets. These circumstancesinclude
 future demand or market conditions for the Company’s  products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes tothe
 Company’s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets, or significant deterioration in the financial  condition of one ormore
 of the Company’s suppliers that hold any of the Company’s manufacturing-related assets or to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment.Such write-downs would adversely a
ffect the Company’s financial condition and operat ing results in the period when the write-downs were recorded.

Table of ContentsThe
 Company accrues for estimated cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been cancelled or are  expected to be cancelled. Consistent withindustry
 practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders in each case based onprojected
 demand.  Where  appropriate,  the  purchases are  applied  to  inventory  component  prepayments  that  are  outstanding  with  the  respective  supplier.Purchase
 commitments typically cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days.  If there is an abruptand
 substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company’s products, a change in the Company’s product development plans, or an unanticipatedchange
 in technological requirements for any of the Company’s  products, the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees thatwould adversely affect it
s results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.Warranty
Costs
The
 Company accrues for the estimated cost of warranties  at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates,historical
 and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company’s typical experience.  The Company regularlyreviews
 these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities or the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection andadjusts
 the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure  rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would berequired and could ma
terially affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Income
Taxes
The
 Company records a tax provision for the anticipated  tax consequences of its reported operating results. The provision for income taxes is computed usingthe
 asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of  temporary differencesbetween
 the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilitiesare measured
 using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to  taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to berealized or settled. The Compan
y records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. The
 Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be  sustained on examination by thetaxing
 authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measuredbased on the largest benefit that has a greater than 
50% likelihood of being realized  upon ultimate settlement.Management
 believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that  may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies,together
 with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Companydetermines all 
or  part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that wouldbe
 charged  to  earnings  in  the  period  such  determination  is made.  In  addition,  the  calculation  of  tax liabilities  involves significant judgment in estimating theimpact
 of  uncertainties  in  the  application  of  GAAP  and  complex  tax  laws.  Resolution  of  these  uncertainties  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  management’sexpectations could hav
e a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Legal
and
Other
Contingencies
As
 discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes  to ConsolidatedFinancial
 Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies,” the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinarycourse
 of  business.  The  Company  records  a  liability  when  it is  probable  that  a  loss  has  been  incurred  and  the  amount  is  reasonably  estimable.  There  issignificant
 judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management,there was not
 at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect toloss
 contingencies  for  asserted  legal  and  other  claims.  However,  the  outcome  of  legal proceedings  and  claims  brought  against  the  Company  is  subject  tosignificant
 uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters wereresolved
 against the Company  in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements forthat reporting period could be mater
ially adversely affected.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Ma rket RiskInterest Rate and Foreign Cur
rency Risk ManagementThe
 Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis  and in conjunction withits underlying foreign cu
rrency and interest rate related exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatorynature
 of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in eitherforeign
 exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related  to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains andlosses related to the underly
ing economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Interest Rate Risk
The
 Company’s  exposure  to  changes  in interest  rates  relates  primarily  to  the  Company’s  investment  portfolio  and  outstanding  debt.  While  the  Company  isexposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the
 Company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Cha nges in U.S.interest
 rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well ascosts associated with hed
ging and interest paid on the Company’s debt. The
 Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s  liquidity requirements. The Company usesa
 combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests inhighly-rated securities, and
 its investment policy generally limits the  amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to beinvestment
 grade,  with  the  primary  objective  of  minimizing  the  potential  risk  of  principal  loss.  To  provide  a meaningful  assessment  of  the  interest  rate  riskassociated with the
 Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would haveon the value of the investment 
portfolio assuming  a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 26, 2015 andSeptember
 27, 2014, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result  in a $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion incrementaldecline in the fair market
 value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.As
 of  September  26,  2015  and  September  27,  2014,  the  Company  had  outstanding  floating-  and  fixed-rate  notes  with  varying  maturities  for  an aggregate carrying
 amount of $56.0 billion and $29.0 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into interest rate swaps to manageinterest
 rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company  to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments orfloating-rate
 payments  into  fixed-rate  payments.  Gains  and  losses  on  these  instruments  are  generally  offset  by  the  corresponding  losses  and  gains  on  therelated 
hedging  instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 26, 2015and September 27, 2014 to increase by $200 mi
llion and $110 million on an annualized basis, respectively. Further details regarding the Co
mpany’s debt is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolida ted Financial Statements in Note 6, “Debt.”Foreign Currency Risk
In
 general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the
 U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have toadjust local currency produc
t pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant vo latility in foreign currency exchange rates.The
 Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts  with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated withcertain
 existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and may
 enter in the future, into non-designated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains andlosses on its foreign-denom
inated debt issuances. The Company’s practice is to hedge a portion of it s material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to 12months.
 However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibit
ive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. 
Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 36

Table of ContentsTo
 provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s  foreign currency derivative positions, the Companyperformed a sensitivity an
alysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted ofusing
 a Monte  Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expectedloss
 in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions  due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model isnot
 intended  to  represent  actual  losses  but  is  used  as  a  risk  estimation  and  management  tool.  The  model  assumes  normal  market  conditions.  Forecastedtransactions,
 firm commitments and assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model,the
 Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $342 million as of September 26, 2015 compared  to a maximum one-dayloss in
 fair value of $240 million as of September 27, 2014. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair valueincurred on those instruments are gene
rally offset by increases in the fair va lue of the underlying exposures.Actual
 future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio and derivative  positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analysesperformed
 as  of  September  26,  2015  due  to  the  inherent  limitations  associated  with  predicting  the  timing  and  amount  of  changes  in  interest  rates,  foreigncurrency 
exchanges rates and the Company’s actua l exposures and positions.

Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 – Summary of Significan
t Accounting PoliciesApple
 Inc.  and  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  (collectively  “Apple”  or  the  “Company”)  designs,  manufactures  and markets  mobile  communication  and  mediadevices,
 personal computers and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party
 digital content and applications. The Company sells  its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as throughthird-party
 cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party  Apple-compatibleproducts,
 including application software and various accessories through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sizedbusinesses and education, enterpri
se and government customers.Basis of Presentation
 and PreparationThe
 accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been  eliminated. Inthe opinion of the Company’s management, the
 consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary forfair
 financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial  statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles(“GAAP”)
 requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  these  consolidated  financial  statements and accompanying notes. Ac
tual results could differ materially from those estimates.The Company’s fiscal 
year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the  last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended onSeptember 26, 2015, September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013, respect
ively. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately ev ery sixyears
 to  realign  fiscal  quarters  with  calendar  quarters.  Fiscal  years  2015,  2014  and  2013  each  spanned  52  weeks.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  references  toparticular
 years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s  fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods ofthose fiscal years.
Revenue Recognition
Net
 sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and  support contracts. TheCompany
 recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectionis probable. Product
 is considered delivered to the customer once it has  been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. Formost
 of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers
 in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portionof
 the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the  Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as paymentsbecome
 due  unless  the  Company  has  positive  evidence  that  the  sales  price  is  fixed  or  determinable,  such  as  a  successful  history  of  collection,  withoutconcession,
 on comparable  arrangements.  The  Company  recognizes  revenue  from  the  sale  of  hardware  products,  software  bundled  with  hardware  that  isessential
 to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with  general revenue recognition accountingguidance.
 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions:(i) standalone
 sales of software products, (ii)  sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of thehardware.
For 
the sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishes itsown
 pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary  obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amountsbilled
 to its customers. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, theCompany does 
not determine the selling pr ice of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales ona
 net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. The portion of the  gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by theCompany to third-party app develope
rs and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 44

Table of ContentsThe Company records deferred revenue when
 it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services.  This includes amountsthat
 have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products.The
 Company sells gift cards redeemable at its  retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store andiBooks
 Store  for  the  purchase  of  digital  content  and  software.  The  Company  records  deferred  revenue  upon  the  sale  of  the  card,  which  is relieved  uponredemption
 of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods.AppleCare
 service and support contracts typically include extended phone support,  repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offeredunder the Company’s st
andard limited warranty.The
 Company records  reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactionsinvolving price protection,
 the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded. For the Company’s other cus tomer incentive programs,the
 estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program isoffered.
 The  Company  also  records reductions  to  revenue  for  expected  future  product  returns  based  on  the  Company’s  historical  experience.  Revenue  isrecorded
 net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as  current liabilities until remittedto the relevant government authority.
Revenue
Recognition
for
Arr

with
Multiple
DeliverablesFor
 multi-element  arrangements  that  include  hardware  products  containing  software  essential  to  the  hardware  product’s  functionality,  undelivered software elements
 that relate to the hardware product’s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverablesbased
 on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a  hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue todeliverables:
 (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) and (iii)  best estimate of selling price(“ESP”).
 VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable.ESPs reflect
 the Company’s best estimates  of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. For multi-elementarrangements
 accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the Company allocates revenue to  all deliverables based on theVSOE of each element, and if VSOE does not e
xist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered.For sales
 of qualifying versions of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch (“iOS devices”), Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device’s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge.
 The Company has identified upto
 three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving the  sale of these devices. The first deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of theallocated
 sales price, is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the
 embedded right included with qualifying devices to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the product’sessential
 software.  The  third  deliverable  is  the  non-software services  to  be  provided  to  qualifying  devices.  The  Company  allocates  revenue  between  thesedeliverables
 using the relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is basedon
 the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the otherconditions
 for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified  software upgrade rights and the non-software services isdeferred
 and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. Costof
 sales related to delivered  hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred toprovide
 non-software  services  are  recognized  as  cost  of  sales  as  incurred,  and  engineering  and  sales  and marketing  costs  are  recognized  as  operatingexpenses as incurred.
The Company’s process for
 determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors  that may vary depending upon the unique factsand
 circumstances related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,product 
specific  business objectives, length of time a particular version of a device has been available, estimated cost to provide the non-software services andthe relative ESP of the upgrade right
s and non-software services as compared to the total selling price of the product. Beginning
 in September 2015, the Company reduced the combined ESPs for iOS devices and Mac between $5 and $10 to reflect  the increase in competitiveoffers
 for similar products at little to no cost for users, which reduces the amount the Company could reasonably charge for these deliverables on a standalonebasis.
Shipping Costs
Amounts billed
 to customers related to shipping and handling  are classified as revenue, and the Company’s shipping and handling costs are classified as cost ofsales.
 
Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 45

Table of ContentsWarranty Costs
The
 Company  generally  provides  for  the  estimated  cost  of  hardware  and  software  warranties  at  the  time  the  related  revenue  is  recognized.  The  Companyassesses the adequacy of its accrued 
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.Software Development Costs
Research
 and development (“R&D”)  costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed aresubject
 to capitalization beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has been established and ending  when a product is available for general release tocustomers.
 In  most  instances,  the  Company’s  products  are  released  soon  after  technological  feasibility  has  been  established  and  as  a  result  softwaredevelopment costs were expensed as 
incurred. Advertising Costs
Advertising
 costs are expensed  as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising expense was $1.8 billion, $1.2 billion and$1.1 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respect
ively.Share-based Compensation
The Company recognizes expense 
related to  share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments ofthe
 Company  or  (b)  liabilities  that  are  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  Company’s  equity  instruments  or  that may  be  settled  by  the  issuance  of  such  equityinstruments.
 Share-based compensation cost for restricted stock and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is measured based on the closing fair market value of theCompany’s
 common  stock  on  the date  of  grant.  The  Company  recognizes  share-based  compensation  cost  over  the  award’s  requisite  service  period  on  astraight-line
 basis  for  time-based  RSUs  and  on  a  graded  basis  for  RSUs  that  are  contingent  on  the  achievement  of  performance conditions.  The Companyrecognizes a
 benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an excess tax benefit is realized. In addition, theCompany
 recognizes the indirect effects of share-based compensation  on R&D tax credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in theConsolidated Statements of Operation
s. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”Income Taxes
The
 provision for income taxes is computed using  the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expectedfuture
 tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating  losses and tax creditcarryforwards.
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in whichthose
 tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized  or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amountthat is believed more l
ikely than not to be realized.The
 Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination  by thetaxing
 authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measuredbased on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% 
likelihood of being realized upon settlement. See Note 5, “Income Taxes” for additional information.Earnings Per Share
Basic
 earnings  per  share  is  computed  by  dividing  income  available  to  common  shareholders  by  the  weighted-average  number  of  shares  of  common  stockoutstanding during the
 period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number ofshares
 of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares  of common stock that would have been outstandingif
 the  potentially  dilutive  securities  had  been  issued.  Potentially  dilutive  securities  include  outstanding  stock  options,  shares  to  be  purchased  under  theCompany’s employee 
stock purchase plan, unvested restr icted stock and unvested RSUs. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in dilutedearnings per share by application of
 the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company’s commonstock can result in a gr
eater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.

Cash
Equivalents
and
Marketable
Securities All
 highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.  The Company’s marketable debtand
 equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management  determines the appropriate classification  of its investments atthe
 time of purchase and reevaluates the classifications at each balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-termor
 long-term based on each instrument’s underlying  contractual maturity date. Marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified asshort-term
 and  marketable  debt  securities  with  maturities  greater  than  12  months  are  classified  as  long-term.  Marketable  equity securities,  including mutualfunds,
 are classified as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. The Company’smarketable
 debt and equity securities are carried at fair  value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of accumulated othercomprehensive
 income  (“AOCI”)  in  shareholders’  equity,  with  the  exception  of  unrealized  losses  believed  to  be other-than-temporary  which  are  reported  inearnings in the current period. The co
st of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.Derivative
Financial
Instruments
The Company accounts for its 
derivative instruments as eit her assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.For
 derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability  in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion ofthe
 gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in  the same period orperiods
 during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized inearnings
 in the current period. To receive hedge accounting treatment,  cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cashflows on
 hedged transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.
For derivative instrument
s that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are des ignated as fair value hedges, both the netgain or loss on the derivati
ve instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current period.For
 derivative instruments and foreign currency debt that hedge the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates used for translation of the net investment
 in a foreign operation and that are designated as a net investment hedge, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative instrument isreported
 in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward  exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Companyexcludes
 changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related tothis 
forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period.Derivatives that do not qual
ify as hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the current period.

Table of ContentsAllowance for Doubtful Accounts
The
 Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors, including historical experience, age of the accountsreceivable balances, cred
it quality of the Company’s customers, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect the customers’ ability to pay.Inventories
Inventories
 are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost, computed  using  the  first-in,  first-out  method  and  net  realizable  value.  Any  adjustments  to  reduce  the  cost  ofinventories
 to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period. As of September 26, 2015 and September  27, 2014, the Company’sinventories consist primarily of finishe
d goods.Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. 
Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated usef ul lives of the assets, whichfor
 buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between one to five years for machinery and equipment, including producttooling and manufacturing process 
equipment; and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs toacquire
 or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related  to internal-use software areamortized
 using  the  straight-line  method  over  the  estimated  useful  lives  of  the  assets,  which  range  from  three  to  five  years.  Depreciation  and  amortizationexpense on property and equipment was $9.2 bi
llion, $6.9 billion and $5.8 billion during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible 
AssetsThe
 Company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived
 assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.Recoverability
 of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to  future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. Ifproperty,
 plant  and  equipment,  inventory  component  prepayments  and  certain  identifiable  intangibles  are  considered  to  be  impaired,  the  impairment  to  berecognized equals the 
amount by which the c arrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value.The
 Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite  useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at leastannually
 or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and intangibleasset
 impairment  tests  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  each  year.  The  Company  did  not  recognize  any  impairment  charges  related  to  goodwill  or  indefinite  livedintangible
 assets  during  2015,  2014  and  2013.  The  Company  established  reporting  units  based  on its  current  reporting  structure.  For  purposes  of  testinggoodwill
 for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. In 2015 and 2014, the Company’sgoodwill was primarily 
allocated to the Americas and Eu rope reporting units.The
 Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful  lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The Companytypically amortizes its acquired inta
ngible assets with definite useful lives over periods from three to seven years.Fair Value Measurements
The
 Company applies fair value accounting  for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fairvalue
 in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received  from  selling  an asset  or paid totransfer a
 liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets andliabilities,
 which  are required  to be  recorded at  fair value,  the  Company  considers  the  principal or most  advantageous  market  in which the  Company  wouldtransact
 and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks  inherent invaluation techniques,
 transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measurefair
 value  into  three  levels  and  bases  the  categorization  within the  hierarchy  upon  the  lowest  level  of  input  that  is  available  and  significant  to  the  fair  valuemeasurement:
Level
1
– Quoted prices in ac tive markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level
2
–  Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted  prices for identical or similar assets or liabilitiesin inactive markets, or othe
r inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level

3
–  Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would  use in pricing theasset or liability.

Table of ContentsThe
 Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable  equity securities were derived from quotedprices in active mar
kets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and all otherfinancial
 instruments, all  of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations usingsignificant inputs der
ived from or corroborated by observable market data.In accordance
 with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair va
lue option for any eligible financial instruments.Foreign Currency Transl
ation and RemeasurementThe Company translates
 the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of
 each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and lossesfrom
 these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in AOCI  in shareholders’ equity. The Company’s subsidiaries that use the U.S.dollar
 as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property andnonmonetary assets 
and liabilities at historical rates.Note 2 – Financial Instruments

   The
 Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including,  but not limited to, anticipation of creditdeterioration and duration management. The matur
ities of the Company’s long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years.As
 of September 26, 2015, the Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature and does
 not consider any of its investments  other-than-temporarily  impaired. The Company typically invests in highly-rated  securities, and its investment  policygenerally
 limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally  requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective ofminimizing the potential
 risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating an investmentfor
 other-than-temporary impairment the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, thefinancial condition of the 
issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates and the Company’s inte nt to sell, or whether it is more likely than not itwill be required to se
ll the investment before recovery of the investment’s cost basis.Derivative Financial Instruments
The
 Company  may  use derivatives  to  partially  offset  its  business  exposure  to  foreign  currency  and  interest  rate  risk  on  expected  future  cash  flows,  on  netinvestments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain
 existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety
 of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be noassurance the hed
ges will offset more than a portion of the financial impa ct resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.To
 help protect gross margins from fluctuations  in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S.dollar
 may  hedge  a  portion  of  forecasted  foreign  currency  revenue,  and  subsidiaries  whose  functional  currency  is  not the  U.S.  dollar  and  who  sell  in  localcurrencies
 may hedge  a portion of forecasted  inventory  purchases  not denominated  in the  subsidiaries’ functional  currencies. The Company  may enter intoforward
 contracts, option contracts or other instruments  to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company typicallyhedges portions of its forecasted fore
ign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To
 help  protect  the  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation  from  adverse  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  the  Company  may  enter into  foreigncurrency forward
 and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.In
 addition,  the  Company  may  use  non-derivative  financial  instruments,  such as  its  foreign  currency-denominated  debt,  as  economic  hedges  of  its  netinvestments in certain fore
ign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges.

Table of ContentsThe
 Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange  gains and losses generated by there-measurement of cer
tain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.The 
Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. These instruments may offset a portion of changesin
 income or expense, or changes in fair value of the Company’s term debt or investments. The  Company designates these instruments as either cash flow orfair value hedges. The Company’
s hedged interest rate transactions as of September 26, 2015 are expected to be recognized within 10 years.Cash
Flow
Hedges
The effective portio
ns of cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI until the  hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cashflow
 hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized,  and deferredgains and
 losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs arerecognized.
 Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges  of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in thesame
 period as the related income or expense is recognized. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedgesare recognized in other income/
(expense), net.Derivative instruments designated
 as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the  forecasted hedged transaction will not occur inthe
 initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instrumentsare
 reclassified immediately  into  other  income/(expense),  net.  Any  subsequent  changes  in  fair  value  of  such  derivative  instruments  are  reflected  in  otherincome/(expense), net unless they a
re re-designated as hedges of other transactions.Net
Investment
Hedges
The
 effective portions of net investment hedges  are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Theineffective portions and amounts ex
cluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net. Fair
Value
Hedges
Gains and losses 
related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in  earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of theunderlying hedged item.
Non-Designated
Derivatives
Derivatives that
 are not designated as  hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivativerelates.
The
 Company records  all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments isbased

Table of ContentsThe
 notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding  and do not represent the amount of theCompany’s
 exposure  to  credit  or  market  loss.  The  credit  risk  amounts  represent  the  Company’s  gross  exposure  to  potential  accounting  loss  on  derivativeinstruments
 that are outstanding or unsettled  if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency  orinterest rates at each respective date. The 
Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk wi ll vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Althoughthe
 table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and
 transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, togetherwith the gains and losses on the under
lying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remain ing life of the instruments.The
 Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit  risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with thesame
 counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received orposted
 when the net fair  value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assetsand
 derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net cash collateral  received  by the Company  related  to derivativeinstruments under its col
lateral security arrangements was $1.0 billion as of September 26, 2015 and $2.1 billion as of September 27, 2014.Under
 master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with
 a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the potential effects of these rights of set-offassociated
 with the Company’s derivative contracts, including  the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilitiesof $2.2 billion and $
1.6 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $78 million and $549 million, respectively. Accounts Receivable
Trade
Receivables
The
 Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small and
 mid-sized  businesses  and  education,  enterprise  and  government  customers.  The  Company  generally  does  not  require  collateral  from  its  customers;however,
 the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition,  when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on tradereceivables
 with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financingarrangements
 are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse orcredit risk sharing 
related to any of these arrangements.As
 of  September  26,  2015,  the  Company  had  one  customer  that  represented  10%  or  more  of  total  trade  receivables,  which  accounted  for  12%.  As  ofSeptember
 27, 2014, the Company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 16% and the other13%.
 The  Company’s  cellular  network  carriers  accounted  for  71%  and  72%  of  trade receivables  as  of  September  26,  2015  and  September  27,  2014,respectively.
Vendor
Non-Trade
Receivables
The
 Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacturesub-assemblies
 or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivablesfrom
 three  of  the  Company’s  vendors  accounted  for  38%,  18%  and  14%  of  total  vendor  non-trade receivables  as  of  September  26,  2015  and  three  of  theCompany’s vendors accounted for 51

   Note 4 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
On
 July 31, 2014, the Company completed the acquisitions of Beats Music, LLC, which offers a subscription streaming music service, and  Beats Electronics,LLC,
 which makes Beats ® headphones, speakers and audio software (collectively, “Beats”). The total purchase price consideration for these acquisitions was$2.6 
billion,  which consisted primarily of cash, of which $2.2 billion was allocated to goodwill, $636 million to acquired intangible assets and $258 million to netliabilities
 assumed. Concurrent with the close of the acquisitions, the Company repaid $295  million of existing Beats outstanding debt to third-party creditors. Inconjunction with
 the Beats acquisitions, the Company issued approximately 5.1 million shares of its common stock to certain former equity holders of Beats. Therestricted
 stock was valued at approximately $485 million based on the Company’s common stock on the acquisition date. The majority of these shares, valuedat approximately $417
 million, will vest over time based on continued employment with Apple. The
 Company also completed various other business acquisitions during 2014 for an aggregate cash consideration, net of cash acquired, of $957 million,  ofwhich $828 million was allocated to
 goodwill, $257 million to acquired intangible assets and $128 million to net liabilities assumed.The
 Company’s acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives primarily consist of patents and licenses and are amortized over periods typically from three to
 seven years. The following table summarizes the components of gross and net intangible asset balances as of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014(in millions):

 foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $47.6 billion, $33.6 billion and $30.5 billion  in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.The
 Company’s  consolidated  financial  statements  provide  for  any  related  tax  liability  on  undistributed  earnings  that  the  Company  does  not  intend  to  beindefinitely reinvested
 outside the U.S. Substantially  all of the Company’s undistributed international earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operationsoutside
 the U.S. were generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, which has a statutory tax rate of 12.5%. As of September  26, 2015, U.S. income taxeshave
 not been provided on a cumulative total of $91.5 billion of such earnings. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these temporarydifferences is estimated 
to be $30.0 billion.As
 of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, $186.9 billion and $137.1 billion, respectively, of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents  and marketablesecurities

 tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits and the future income tax effects of temporary  differences between the consolidatedfinancial
 statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply totaxable income in the y
ears in which those temporary differences are expected to be re covered or settled.Uncertain Tax Positions
Tax
 positions are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination.
 If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in thefinancial statements. The tax
 position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater  than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. TheCompany
 classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year asnon-current liabilities in the Cons
olidated Balance Sheets.As
 of September 26, 2015, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $6.9  billion, of which $2.5 billion, if recognized, would affect the Company’seffective
 tax rate. As of September 27, 2014, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $4.0 billion, of which $1.4 billion, if recognized, wouldaffect the Company’s 
effective tax rate.The
 aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties,  for 2015, 2014 and 2013, is as follows (inmillions):

Table of ContentsThe
 Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state  and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. InternalRevenue
 Service (the “IRS”) is currently examining the years 2010 through 2012, and all years prior to 2010 are closed. In addition, the Company is subject toaudits
 by state, local and foreign  tax authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and couldbe subject to examination by the tax
ing authorities.Management
 believes that an adequate  provision has been made for any adjustments  that may result from tax examinations.  However, the outcome  of taxaudits
 cannot be predicted with certainty.  If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’sexpectations,
 the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in  the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolutionand/or
 closure of audits is not certain, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in thenext 
12 months. On
 June 11, 2014, the European Commission issued an opening decision initiating a formal investigation against Ireland for alleged  state aid to the Company.The
 opening decision concerns the allocation of profits for taxation purposes of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company. The Company believesthe
 European  Commission’s  assertions  are  without merit.  If  the  European  Commission  were  to  conclude  against  Ireland,  the  European  Commission  couldrequire
 Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid. While such amount could be material, as of September 26, 2015 the Compan
y is unable to estimate the impact.Note 6 – Debt
Commercial Paper
In
 2014, the Board of Directors  authorized the Company to issue unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paperprogram.
 The  Company  intends  to  use  net  proceeds  from  the  commercial  paper  program  for  general  corporate purposes,  including  dividends  and  sharerepurchases. As
 of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the Company had $8.5 billion and $6.3 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, respectively,with a weighted-average in

Table of ContentsShare Repurchase Program
In
 the third quarter of 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization to $140 billion of the Company’s common stock, of which $104
 billion had been utilized as of September 26, 2015. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number ofshares.
 Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated  and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).The Company
 has entered, and in the future may enter, into accelerated share repurchase arrangements (“ASRs”) with financial institutions. In exchange for up- front
 payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase periods of each ASR. The total number of sharesultimately
 delivered, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per  share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR basedon the volume weighted-average price of the Company’s common stock during that period. The
 shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and the
 up-front payments are accounted for as a reduction to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in the periods the payments aremade.
 The Company reflects the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock in the period  delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forwardcontracts
 indexed  to  its  own  common  stock.  The  ASRs  met  all  of  the  applicable  criteria  for  equity  classification,  and  therefore  were  not  accounted  for  asderivative 
instruments. The following table show

2014
Employee
Stock
Plan
In
 the second quarter  of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and terminated the Company’s authority to grant newawards
 under  the  2003  Employee  Stock  Plan  (the  “2003  Plan”).  The  2014  Plan  provides for  broad-based  equity  grants  to  employees,  including  executiveofficers, and
 permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards.RSUs
 granted under the 2014  Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’scommon
 stock on a one-for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduces the number  of shares available for grantunder
 the plan by two shares. RSUs cancelled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant underthe
 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number  of RSUs cancelled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividendequivalent
 rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject  to the samevesting
 and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approvalof the 2014
 Plan, the Company reserved 385 million shares plus the number of shares remaining that  were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Sharessubject
 to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are cancelled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations withrespect
 to RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 26, 2015, approximately 442.9 million shares were reserved for futureissuance under the 2014 Plan.

The
 2003 Plan is a shareholder approved  plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan permittedthe
 granting  of  incentive  stock  options,  nonstatutory  stock  options,  RSUs,  stock  appreciation  rights,  stock  purchase  rights and  performance-based  awards.Options
 granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years,based
 on continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or  quarterly vesting. RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan generally vest over two to four years,based
 on continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs, other than RSUsheld
 by the Chief Executive Officer, granted under the 2003 Plan have DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as thecorresponding
 unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. In the second  quarter of 2014, the Company terminated theauthority to grant new awards under the 2003 P

Stock
Plan
The
 1997 Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock  options to theCompany’s
 non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automaticannual
 grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders,  and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stockoptions
 and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to these
 grants without shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduces the number of shares available forgrant
 under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan expires November  9, 2019. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs aresubject
 to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying sharesvest. As of September 26, 2015, approximate

  The
 fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $4.8 billion, $3.4 billion and $3.1 billion for 2015, 2014 and  2013, respectively. The majority ofRSUs
 that vested in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees’ minimumstatutory
 obligation for the applicable income and other  employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheldwere
 approximately  14.1  million,  15.6  million  and  15.5  million  for  2015,  2014  and  2013,  respectively,  and  were  based  on  the value  of  the  RSUs  on  theirrespective
 vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $1.6billion,
 $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in 2015, 2014 and  2013, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of CashFlows. These net-share
 settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and d
id not represent an expense to the Company.Stock Options
The
 Company had 1.2 million stock options outstanding as of September 26, 2015, with a weighted-average exercise price per share of $15.08 and weighted- average
 remaining contractual term of 4.1 years, substantially all of which are exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value of the stock options outstanding as ofSeptember
 26, 2015 was $120 million, which represents the value of the Company’s  closing stock price on the last trading day of the period in excess of theweighted-average exercise
 price multiplied by the number of options outstanding. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $479 million, $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respect

   The Company
 generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software  infringes third-partyintellectual
 property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could besubject
 to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement  claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, therewas
 not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating  system orapplication
 software  for  infringement  of  third-party  intellectual  property  rights.  The  Company  did  not  record  a  liability  for  infringement  costs  related  toindemnification as of Septembe
r 26, 2015 or September 27, 2014.In September 2015, the Company introduced the i
Phone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase an iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in one of its U.S. physical retail stores and
 activate the purchased iPhone with one of the four national carriers. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right totrade
 in that iPhone for a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. One of  the conditions of this program requires the customer to finance the initialpurchase
 price of the iPhone with a third-party lender. Upon exercise of the trade-in right and purchase of a new iPhone, the Company satisfies the customer’soutstanding
 balance due to the third-party lender on the original device. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizesarrangement revenue net of the fair value of such 
right with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized  within revenue.The
 Company  has  entered  into  indemnification  agreements  with  its  directors  and  executive  officers. Under  these  agreements,  the  Company  has  agreed  toindemnify
 such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advanceexpenses
 incurred by such individuals  in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of paymentsthe
 Company  could  be  required  to  make  under  these  agreements  due  to  the  limited  history  of  prior  indemnification claims  and  the  unique  facts  andcircumstances
 involved  in  each  claim.  However,  the  Company  maintains  directors  and  officers  liability  insurance  coverage  to  reduce  its  exposure  to  suchobligations.
Concentrations in the Available Sources of 
Supply of Materials and ProductAlthough
 most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently obtained from
 single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication andmedia
 devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company,  including those that are available from multiple sources, are attimes
 subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operatingresults.
 
Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 64

Table of ContentsThe Company uses some custom component
s that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Com pany often utilize customcomponents
 available from only one source. When a component  or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’yields
 have  matured  or  manufacturing capacity  has  increased.  If  the  Company’s  supply  of  components  for  a  new  or  existing  product  were  delayed  orconstrained,
 or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and  operating resultscould
 be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the timerequired
 to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or  to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability ofthese
 components  at  acceptable  prices,  or  at  all,  may  be  affected  if  those  suppliers  concentrated  on  the  production  of  common  components  instead  ofcomponents customized to meet the Compan
y’s requirements.The Company
 has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can  be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend orrenew
 these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases thatcould materially 
adversely affect its fina ncial condition and operating results.Substantially
 all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing  partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration ofthis manufacturing
 is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole- sourced
 suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company’s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners onmanufacturing
 schedules,  the  Company’s  operating  results  could  be  adversely affected  if  its  outsourcing  partners  were  unable  to  meet  their  productioncommitments. The Company’s 
purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.Other Off-Balance Sheet
 CommitmentsOperating Leases
The
 Company  leases  various  equipment  and  facilities,  including  retail  space,  under  noncancelable  operating  lease  arrangements.  The  Company  does  notcurrently
 utilize  any  other  off-balance  sheet  financing  arrangements.  The  major  facility  leases  are  typically  for  terms  not  exceeding  10  years  and  generallycontain
 multi-year renewal options. As of September 26, 2015, the Company had a total of  463 retail stores. Leases for retail space are for terms ranging fromfive
 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 26, 2015, the Company’s total futureminimum 
lease payments under  noncancelable operating leases were $6.3 billion, of which $3.6 billion related to leases for retail space.Rent
 expense under all  operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $794 million, $717 million and $645 million in 2015, 2014and
 2013,  respectively.  Future  minimum  lease  payments  under  noncancelable  operating  leases  having  remaining  terms in  excess  of  one  year  as  ofSeptember 26, 20

   Other Commitments
The
 Company utilizes  several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing offinished
 products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information  supplied by the Company, which typicallycovers
 periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent withindustry practice, the Com
pany acquires components through a combination of  purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demandinformation.
 Where  appropriate,  the  purchases  are  applied  to  inventory  component  prepayments  that are  outstanding  with  the  respective  supplier.  As  ofSeptember
 26, 2015, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $29.5billion.
 
Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 65

Table of ContentsIn addition to the commitments ment
ioned above, the Company had other off-balance sheet obligations of $7.3 billion as of September 26, 2015 that con sisted ofcommitments
 to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to inventory prepayments,advertising, licensing, R&D, interne
t and telecommunications services , energy and other obligations.Contingencies
The
 Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated, certain
 of which are discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” and in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading“Legal Proceedings.” In
 the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable po ssibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a materialloss
 in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome  of litigation  is inherentlyuncertain.
 Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolvedagainst
 the  Company  in  a  reporting  period  for  amounts  in excess  of  management’s  expectations,  the  Company’s  consolidated  financial  statements  for  thatreporting period could be mater
ially adversely affected.Apple

Co.,
Ltd,
et
al.On 
August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd and affiliated parties in theUnited
 States  District  Court,  Northern  District  of  California,  San  Jose  Division.  On March  6,  2014,  the  District  Court  entered  final  judgment  in  favor  of  theCompany
 in the amount of approximately $930 million. On May 18, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed in part, and reversed in part,the
 decision of the District Court. As a result, the Court of Appeals ordered entry of final judgment on damages in the amount of approximately $548 million, withthe
 District Court to determine supplemental damages and interest, as well as damages owed  for products subject to the reversal in part. Because the rulingremains subject to further proceed
ings, the Company has not recognized the award in its results of operations.Note 11 – Segment Information and Geog
raphic DataThe
 Company  reports  segment  information  based  on  the  “management”  approach.  The  management  approach  designates  the  internal reporting  used  bymanagement for making decision
s and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable operating segments.The 
Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, GreaterChina,
 Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South America.  The Europe segment includes European countries, aswell
 as  India,  the  Middle  East  and  Africa.  The  Greater  China  segment  includes  China,  Hong  Kong  and  Taiwan.  The  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific  segment  includesAustralia
 and those Asian countries not included  in the Company’s other reportable operating segments. Although each reportable operating segment providessimilar
 hardware and software products and similar services, they are managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s  customers anddistribution
 partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each  geographic  region.  The  accounting  policies  of  the  various  segments  are  the  same  as  thosedescribed in Note 1, “Summ
ary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The Company evaluates
 the performance of its reportable operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally
 based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for eachsegment
 includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and  operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generallyincluded in the
 geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses
 managed outside the reportable operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such asR&D,
 corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various nonrecurring charges and other separately managedgeneral and administrative 
costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.

 is responsible for maintaining effective internal control  over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control overfinancial
 reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is  to express anopinion on the Company’s inte
rnal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We
 conducted our audit in accordance with  the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that weplan
 and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was maintained  in  all  materialrespects.
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testingand
 evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal  control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considerednecessary in the circum
stances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company’s internal
 control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statement
s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting
 includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  thetransactions
 and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
 financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance
 with authorizations of management and directors of  the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, use, o
r disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any evaluation  ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.In
 our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2015, based on  the COSOcriteria.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountan ts on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.
 
Item 9A.
Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and P
roceduresBased
 on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial
 officer  have  concluded  that  the  Company’s  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  as  defined  in  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  under  the  SecuritiesExchange
 Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) were effective as  of September 26, 2015 to provide reasonable assurance that information required tobe
 disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
 specified  in  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  rules  and  forms  and  (ii)  accumulated  and  communicated  to  the  Company’s  management,including its principal executive of
ficer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding r equired disclosure.Inherent Limitations
 Over Internal ControlsThe
 Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting and  thepreparation
 of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internalcontrol over financial repor
ting includes those policies and procedures that:  
 
(i)pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  Company’sassets;
 
 
(ii)provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP,and
 that  the Company’s  receipts  and  expenditures  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  the  Company’s  management  anddirectors; and
 
 
(iii)provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets thatcould 
have a material effect on the financia l statements.Management,
 including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial  Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent ordetect
 all errors  and  all fraud.  A control  system,  no  matter  how well designed  and  operated,  can  provide  only reasonable,  not  absolute,  assurance  that  theobjectives
 of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits ofcontrols
 must  be  considered  relative  to  their  costs.  Because  of  the  inherent  limitations in  all  control  systems,  no  evaluation  of  internal  controls  can  provideabsolute
 assurance  that  all control  issues and  instances  of  fraud,  if any,  have  been  detected.  Also, any  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  controls  in futureperiods are subject 
to  the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedur

 26, 2015 to provide  reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordancewith
 GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued  an audit report on the Company’s internal controlover financial reporting,

 evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likelyto materially affect, 
the Company’s internal con trol over financial reporting.
