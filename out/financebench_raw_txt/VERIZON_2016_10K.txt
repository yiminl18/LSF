General
Verizon Com munications Inc. (Verizon, or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’ s leading providers of
communications, inform ation and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies. With a presence around the world,
we offer voice, data and video services and solutions on our wireless and wireline networks that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility , reliable
network connectivity , security and control. Formerly known as Bell Atlantic Corporation (Bell Atlantic), we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State
of Delaware . We began doing business as Verizon on June 30, 2000 following our merger with GTE Corporation. We have a highly diverse workforce of
approximately 160,900 employees.
Our principal executive of fices are located at 1095 A venue of the Americas, New Y ork, New Y ork 10036 (telephone number 212-395-1000).
We have two reportable segments, Wireless and W ireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business segments and or ganize by products and services.
 
Wireless
 Wireless’ communications products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided
to consumer , business and government customers across the United States.
Wireline
 Wireline’ s voice, data and video communication s products and enhanced services include broadband video and data, corporate
networking solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice
services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and
government customers both in the United States and around the world.
Additional discussion of our reportable segments  is included in the 2016 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners under the headings “Management’ s Discussion
and Analysis of Financia l Condition and Results  of Operations - Overview and - Segment Results of Operations” and in Note 12 to the consolidated financial
statements of V erizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which are incorporated by reference into this report.
 
Wireless
Backgr ound
Our Wireles s segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications services and products across one of the most extensive wireless
networks in the United States (U.S.). Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless service provider in the United States as measured by retail connections and revenue.
At December 31, 2016, Verizon Wireless had 114.2 million retail connections and 2016 revenues of approximately $89.2 billion, representing approximately 71%
of Verizon’ s aggregate revenues.
Cellco Partnership (Cellco), which originally held the wireless assets of Bell Atlantic, began operating as “Verizon Wireless” in April 2000 with both Vodafone
Group Plc (Vodafone) and Bell Atlantic as partners, following Vodafone’ s contribution of its U.S. wireless assets into Cellco. On September 2, 2013, Verizon
entered into a stock purchase agreement with Vodafone and Vodafone 4 Limited, pursuant to which Verizon agreed to acquire all of Vodafone’ s indirect 45%
interest in Verizon Wireless for aggregate consid eration of approximately $130 billion (the Wireless Transaction). We completed the Wireless Transaction on
February 21, 2014 and, as a result, we acquired 100% ownership of Verizon Wireless. The consideration paid was primarily comprised of cash and Verizon
common stock.
We have the largest fourth-generation (4G) Long-T erm Evolution (LTE) technology and third-gen eration (3G) Evolution - Data Optimized (EV-DO)  networks of
any U.S. wireless service provider . Our 4G LTE network is available to over 98% of the U.S. population in more than 500 markets covering approximately
314 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. Under this program, we are working with wireless carriers in rural
areas to collaboratively build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carrier ’s network assets and our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 MHz C Block and
Advanced W ireless Services (A WS) spectrum.
We are adding capacity and density to our 4G LTE network. We are committed to developing and deploying fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology and are
working with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development and appropriate requirements for this next generation of wireless
technology . Based on the outcome of our ongoing pre-commercial  trials, we intend to be the first company to deploy a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in
the United States. W e expect to launch a fixed commercial wireless service supported by this network in 2018.

Wireless Service and Pr oduct Offerings
Our wireless services are available to our custom ers receiving service under the Verizon Wireless brand. In addition, customers can obtain wireless products and
services that operate on our network from resellers that purchase network access from us on a wholesale basis.
Wireless Services
We offer our wireless services on a postpaid and prepaid basis. Retail (non-wholesale)  postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers with Verizon
Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its branded services.  A single account may include monthly wireless services for a
variety of connected devices. A postpaid retail connection represents an individual line of service for a wireless device for which a customer is billed in advance a
monthly access charge in return for a monthly network service allowance, and usage beyond the allowance is billed in arrears. Approximately 95% of our total
retail connec tions were postpaid retail connectio ns as of December 31, 2016. Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit
verification by paying for all services in advance.
We offer various postpai d account service plans, including shared data plans, single connection plans and other plans tailored to the needs of our customers. Our
shared data plans typical ly feature domestic unlimited voice minutes, unlimited domestic and international text, video and picture messaging, and a single data
allowance that can be shared among the wireless devices on a customer ’s account. These allowances will vary from time to time as part of promotional offers or
in response to market circumstances. On February 12, 2017, we announced an introductory plan, our new Verizon Unlimited plan, available to our consumer and
small busine ss customers, which offers among other things, unlimited domestic voice, data and texting. Both our shared data plans and the Verizon Unlimited
plan include our HD (High Definition) Voice, Video Calling and Mobile Hotspot services on comp atible devices. HD Voice is a suite of services enabled by Voice
over LTE (VoLTE), which delivers calls over our 4G LTE network, and our Video Calling service combines an HD Voice call with real-time video. Our Mobile
Hotspot service enables a customer to activate a personal Wi-Fi hotspot via their smartphone that can provide Internet access to multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices.
We also of fer various voice and shared data plans for small and lar ge businesses.
Our simplified shared data plan, the new Verizon Plan, offers customers various sizes of data pack ages that can be shared among up to 10 devices on a consumer
account or 25 devices on a business account. The plan features Carryover Data, which allows customers to carry over unused data to the next month, and Safety
Mode, which enables customers to avoid data overage fees by allowing them to continue using data at a reduced data speed after using their data allowance.
Certain plans, with higher account access amounts also include calling to and voice, text and data roaming in Mexico and Canada. Customers who wish to
participate in this new plan can do so by purchasing a device from Verizon either under our device payment program or at full retail, or by using their own
compatible device.
Customers on our fixed-term service plans have historically paid higher access fees for their wirele ss service in exchange for the ability to purchase their wireless
devices at subsidized prices. We have largely discontinued this form of device subsidy . Unde r the Verizon device payment program, our eligible wireless
customers purchase wireless devices under a device payment plan agreement. Customers that activate service on devices purchased under the device payment
program or on a compati ble device that they already own pay lower access fees (unsubsidized service pricing) as compared to those under our fixed-term service
plans. Gener ally, custom ers entering into device  payment plan agreements on or after June 1, 2015 are required to repay all amounts due under their device
payment plan agreement before being eligible to upgrade their device. However , certain devices are subject to promotions that allow customers to upgrade to a
new device after paying down a specified percentage of the balance on their device payment plan and trading in their device in good working condition.
We also offer prepaid single connection service plans that feature domestic unlimited voice minutes and unlimited domestic and international text. On compatible
devices, certain of our prepaid plans also feature  video and picture messaging, Carryover Data and Always-On  Data, which allows a customer to stay online at
reduced data speeds after using their data allowance. HD Voice, Video Calling and Mobile Hotsp ot service are available on compatible devices. Customers can
manage their prepaid services on the device using their My V erizon Mobile application or logging in to the My V erizon website.
We offer our customers a wide variety of wirele ss services accessible on a broad range of devices. Access to the Internet is available on all smartphones and
nearly all basic phones. We also offer service that enables our customers to access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets
that either have embedded 4G LTE or 3G EV-DO modules or that are used in conjunction with separate devices that enable access to this service, such as USB
modems, Jetpacks  and other dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection.
Our custome rs can access multimedia offerings, provided by Verizon and by third parties, consisting of applications providing music, video, gaming, news and
other content. Our busin ess-focused offerings, which are designed to increase productivity , include solutions that enable customers to access the Internet, their
corporate intranets and e-mail  across our diverse portfolio of wireless devices. Our location-based services provide our customers with directions to their
destination and enable our business customers to locate, monitor and communicate with their mobile field workers. Our global data services allow our customers
to access data services and the Internet on all smartphones and many tablets and basic phones from hundreds of international destinations that we sell. A majority
of the wirele ss devices used by our customers can run applications and services offered by Googl e (a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.) via Google Play or Apple Inc.
(Apple) via iT unes.
Our customers can also make and receive calls on their home phone handsets using our wireless network through our Home Phone Connect service or Verizon 4G
LTE Broadb and Router with Voice service. We also offer LTE Internet (Installed), a high-speed Internet service that provides customers with Internet connections
in their homes using our 4G L TE network.

We provide network access and, in some cases, enhanced value-added services to support wireless connections for the Internet of Things (IoT). Our IoT services
offer end-to-end  solutions for various IoT vertical markets, such as:
 
 • Fleet management and telematics – We provide in-vehicle  solutions that enable vehicle navigation, GPS tracking, engine diagnostic monitoring and
maintenance alerts;
 
 • Energy – We offer solutions targeted to providing  the energy sector with greater visibility into energy usage and the ability to remotely monitor devices
used to track ener gy usage;
 
 • Agricultural technology – W e provide solutions that give farmers critical data they need to improve yields and save costs; and
 
 • Smart Communities – Our solutions enable localities to collect data from IoT and connected machine technologies with the goal of improving public
safety , managing traffic, reducing pollution, identifying revenue generation opportunities, making efficient use of limited resources and attracting
businesses, residents and workers.
We also work with vario us companies that purchase network access from us to connect their Open Development certified devices, bundled together with their
own solutions, which they sell to end-users.
Wireless Devices
We offer several categories of wireless devices, including smartphones and basic phones, tablets and other Internet access devices.
Smartphones and Basic Phones . All of the smartphones we of fer are enabled to utilize our 4G L TE and 3G EV-DO high-speed data services. These devices run on
various operating platforms, primarily Apple iOS and Google Android. The basic phones we of fer are 3G EV-DO-enabled  and have HTML-browsing capability .
Tablets and Other Internet Devices.  We offer tablets from multiple manufacturers, all of which can access the Internet via our 4G LTE network or a Wi-Fi
connection. The tablets run primarily on the Apple iOS and Google Android operating systems. In addition, we offer dedicated devices, which we refer to as
Jetpacks that provide a mobile Wi-Fi 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO connection and are capable of connecting multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices to the Internet at one
time. Our customers can also access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on their computers via data cards, USB modems or through the use of certain
laptop computers and netbooks enabled to access our wireless network.
We purchase a substantial majority of our wireless devices and accessories from Apple, Samsung, Motorola Mobility , Google, LG Electronics and HTC.
A key component of all wireless devices is the chipset, which contains the “intelligence” of the device. The LTE chipsets used in our 4G LTE-enabled  devices are
manufactured by various companies, each using its own 4G LTE chipset technology . To support Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)-1XR TT and EV-DO
technologies (with and without 4G LTE), most of our wireless device suppliers currently rely on Qualcomm Incorporated for the manufacture and supply of
chipsets. In addition, there are a number of other components common to wireless devices provid ed by various electronic component manufacturers that we do
not deal with directly .
Network
We have the largest 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO netwo rks of any service provider in the United States, with licensed and operational coverage in all of the 100 most
populous U.S. metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2016, our 4G L TE network covered approximately 314 million people in the United States, including those
in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. We currently have 21 LTE in Rural Amer ica partners that provide 4G LTE coverage to an area covering
approximately three million people.
The reliabili ty of our wireless network is a key factor for our continued success, and we strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for
their wireless services. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services that
will fuel profitable growth. The depth and breadth of our network provides our fundamental strength and is the basis for our competitive advantage.
We design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the numb er of successful data sessions, including video, permitting the
completion of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds, and maximizes the number of calls that are connected on
the first attem pt and completed without being dropped. We plan to continue to upgrade our network, primarily to increase its capacity and density , by utilizing
small cell technology , in-building  solutions and distributed antennae systems in addition to deploying existing AWS spectrum. We are also exploring strategic
opportunities to increase our network capacity and ef ficiency through selective acquisitions of spectrum licenses.
Our network  includes various elements of redun dancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our
operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every macrocell in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macrocells and at
every switch  location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed, if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully
redundant Multiprotocol Label Switching backbone network in critical locations.

Table of Contents
In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless
service in nearly all other areas in the United States where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to
our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the Unite d States. Certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated
at will by either party upon several months’ notice; however , we do not believe that the termina tion of any of these at-will  agreements would have  a material
adverse ef fect on our business.
Technology
Our primary network technology platforms are 4G LTE and 3G CDMA. 4G LTE provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost
compared to that of fered by 3G technologies.
In 2014, we commercially launched our mobile VoLTE service. HD Calling, enabled by VoLTE, is now being used, in addition to CDMA  technology , to provide
voice calling services to our customers.
We are committed to developing and deploying 5G wireless technology . We are densifying our 4G LTE network to add capacity and pre-position  us for 5G
technology . We launched the Verizon 5G Technology Forum with key industry partners to develop 5G requirements and standards and conduct testing to
accelerate the introductio n of 5G technologies. We believe that 5G technology will provide higher throughput than the current 4G LTE technology , lower latency
and the ability to handle more network traffic as the number of Internet-connected devices grows. Based on the outcome of our ongoing pre-commercial  trials, we
intend to be the first company to deploy a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in the United States. We expect to launch a fixed commercial wireless service
supported by this network in 2018.
Spectrum
The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services. We have licenses to provide these wireless services on
portions of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellular spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum,
portions of the 700 MHz upper C band and AWS spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands, in areas that, collectively , cover nearly all of the population of the
United States.
In January 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum in the AWS-3  band. We participated in that
auction and were the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. The FCC granted us these spectrum licenses in
April 2015.
We anticipate we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. This increasing demand is driven by growth in customer connections and the increased
usage of wireless broadband services, that use more bandwidth and require ever faster rates of speed. Additional spectrum may also allow us to offer new
products enabled by advances in technology , including emer ging 5G and IoT services. We can meet our future spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing
spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur . In March 2016, the FCC
commenced a voluntary incentive auction of television broadcast spectrum in the 600 MHz frequency range. The auction has finished the reverse and forward
clock phases. Any result s will be disclosed by the FCC after the completion of the assignment phase and after the FCC announces the close of the auction by
public notice.
Since we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain  markets and may have spectrum surpluses in others, from time
to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar
opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future. In other cases, we have entered into intra-
market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves
network performance and efficiency . These swaps as well as any spectrum purchases are subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum
licenses in each instance.
Additional information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in the 2016 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements of V erizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report.
Network Equipment and Build-out
Nokia and Ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our LTE network deployments for macro sites as well as small cells. Our primary CDMA cell
site equipment infrastructure vendors are Nokia, which provides more than half of our CDMA cell site equipment, and Ericsson, which provides nearly all of our
remaining cell site equipment. W e also rely on Nokia and Ericsson for our switching equipment.
As we continue to build and upgrade our existing network, we must complete a variety of steps,  including securing rights to a large number of sites as well as
obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for both our macro and small cells. As we densify our network, we follow a similar process
for small cells, in-building  systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We utilize tower site management firms,
such as Crown Castle International Corp. and American T ower Corporation (American T ower), as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing tower sites.
During Marc h 2015, we completed a transaction  with American Tower pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate
approximately 1 1,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. Under the terms of the lease agreements, American
 
6
Table of Contents
Tower has exclusive rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, American Tower has fixed-price
purchase options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this transaction, we also sold 162
towers for $0.1 billion. W e have subleased capacity on the towers from American T ower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates, with options to renew .
Marketing and Distribution
Our marketi ng strategy is focused on offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customer market groups; promoting our brand; leveraging our
extensive distribution network; and jointly mark eting our products and services to large business and government customers with Verizon’ s Wireline business
units through  the Wireless Business Group, a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of Verizon Wireless’ solutions for medium and large business
and government customers. Our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television, print, radio, outdoor signage, Internet and point-of-sale  media
promotions designed to present our corporate message consistently across all of our markets. We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution
channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs.
Company-operated store s are a core component of our distribution strategy . We have Verizon Destination Stores in various major metropolitan areas, which focus
on the mobile lifestyle and highlight the many ways consumers can use wireless technology in their daily lives. These stores are part of a broader initiative that
includes the redesign of our retail stores nationwide into “Smart Stores,” which showcase the same mobile lifestyle zones on a smaller scale. In addition, our
direct channel includes our business-to-business  sales operations and systems organization and is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of
consumers and local, regional and national business customers. In addition, we have a telemar keting sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from
customers, and we of fer fully-automated, end-to-end  web-based  sales of wireless devices, accessories and service plans.
Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the United States, as well as
through the Internet. The majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services, and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with
us. We also have relation ships with high-profile national retailers, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart  and Target, to sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and
services. Stores such as Dollar General and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry . We compete against other national wireless service providers, including AT&T Inc., Sprint Corporation and
T-Mobile  USA,  Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service
from facilities-based wireless service providers for resale, including resellers that buy from us. Competition is intense as a result of continuing increases in
wireless market penetration levels, network investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of new
products and services, new market entrants, the availability of additional spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, and regulatory changes. Competition may also
increase as smaller , stand-alone wireless service providers mer ge or transfer licenses to lar ger, better capitalized wireless service providers.
The wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology comp anies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture
customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional  offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsof t,
Google, Apple and other s are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless provider ’s voice
service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content.
We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry:
 
 • Network reliability , capacity and coverage.  We believe that a wireless network that consistently provides high-quality and reliable service is a key
differentiator in the U.S. market and driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new wireless service of ferings, which in
many cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of wireless services, which, in turn, puts pressure on network capacity . In order
to compete effectively , wireless service providers must keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through their
networks. W e believe that our investments in our 4G L TE network to increase network capacity will enable us to meet consumer demand.
 
 • Pricing. Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to
grow , we and other wireless service providers are offering service plans at competitive prices that include unlimited voice minutes and text messages
and a specifi c amount of data access in varying megabyte or gigabyte sizes or, in some cases, on an unlimited basis subject to certain restrictions. These
allowances will vary from time to time as part of promotional offers or in response to market  circumstances. We and many other wireless service
providers also allow customers on certain plans to carry over unused data allowances to the next billing period, or to stay online at a reduced data speed
after using all of a data allowance for a billing period. In addition, some wireless service providers have bundled wireless service offerings with other
products while others of fer promotional pricing and incentives tar geted specifically to customers of V erizon W ireless.
We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options that distinguish service pricing from
equipment pricing and blur the traditional boundary between prepaid and postpaid plans. These payment options include device payment plans,
 
7
Table of Contents
which provid e customers  with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and device leasing arrangements. Historically , wireless service
providers offered customers wireless plans wher eby, in exchange for the customer entering into a fixed-term service agreement, the wireless service
provider significantly , and in some cases fully, subsidized the customer ’s device purchase. Wireless providers recovered those subsidies through higher
service fees as compared to those paid by custom ers on device payment plans. We and many other wireless providers have limited or discontinued this
form of device subsidy .
 
 • Customer service. We believe that high-qua lity customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting  new customers, including those of
other wireless providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use
products and services and focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. Our competitors also recognize the
importance of customer service and are also focused on improving in this area.  As part of our efforts to transform and simplify the customer experience,
we launched a new My V erizon app, which allows customers to manage their price plan, data usage, account and billing from their device. As part of our
efforts to promote long-term relationships with our customers, we of fer V erizon Smart Rewards, which is a program that of fers a wide variety of rewards
to customers in exchange  for points they earn in connection with their account-related interactions with Verizon Wireless. The program offers customers
discounts and savings on merchandise from well-known brands, as well as discounts and other of fers at local shopping and dining venues.
 
 • Product and service development. As wireless technologie s develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate, continued custo mer and revenue
growth will be increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced data products and services. We continue to pursue the development and
rapid deployment of new and innovative wireless products and services both independently and in collaboration with application and content providers.
We also collaborate with various device manufacturers in the development of distinctive smartp hones and other wireless devices that can access the
growing array of data applications and content available over the Internet. We continue to focus on increasing the penetration of smartphones, tablets
and other connected devices throughout our customer base.
 
 • Sales and distribution. The key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales chann els and distribution points. We
believe that attaining the optimal combination of varying distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leading profitability , as measured by
operating income. We endeavor to increase sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing, web-based  sales and
fulfillment capabilities, our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations, and through manufacturers of
laptops and netbooks with embedded 4G LTE and 3G modules that can access the Internet on our network at broadband speeds. In addition, we sell
network access to both traditional resellers, which resell network services to their end-users,  and to various compa nies to enable wireles s
communications for their IoT devices or services.
 
 • Capital resour ces. In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers
require significant capital resources. W e generate significant cash flow from operations, as do some of our competitors.
Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors af fecting the wireless industry , including the factors described above, as well as
new technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies of
competitors.
 
Wireline
Backgr ound
Our Wireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services. We provide these products and services to consumers in
the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United  States and around the world. In 2016, Wireline revenues were
$31.3 billion, representing approximately 25% of V erizon’ s aggregate revenues.
Strategic T ransactions
On February 5, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to which Verizon sold its local
exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines
and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states, for approxi mately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.3 billion net of income
taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier . The transaction, which included the
acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon’ s incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and Texas, did not involve any assets
or liabilities of V erizon W ireless. The transaction closed on April 1, 2016.
The transaction resulted in Frontier acquiring approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video
subscribers and the related ILEC businesses from Verizon. Approximately 9,300 Verizon empl oyees who served customers in California, Florida and Texas
continued employment with Frontier . The opera ting results of these businesses are excluded from our Wireline segment for all periods presented to reflect
comparable segment operating results consistent with the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker .

On February 20, 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire XO Holdings’  wireline business, which owns and operates one of the largest fiber-based
IP and Ethernet networks , for approximately $1.8 billion, subject to adjustment. We completed the acquisition on February 1, 2017. Separately , we entered into an
agreement to lease certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO Holdings that holds its wireless spectrum. Verizon has an option, exercisable
under certain circumstances, to buy that subsidiary .
We are reinventing our network architecture around a common fiber platform that will support both our wireless and wireline technologies. We expect that this
new “One Fiber” architecture will improve our 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of 5G, deliver high-speed Fios broadband to homes and businesses and
create new opportunities  in the small and medium business market. In April 2016, we announced our One Fiber strategy for the city of Boston. We launched One
Fiber for consumer and business services to customers in Boston late in 2016.
On December 6, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with Equinix, Inc. pursuant to which Verizon will sell 24 customer -facing data center sites in the
United State s and Latin America for approximate ly $3.6 billion, subject to certain adjustments. The sale does not affect Verizon’ s data center services delivered
from 27 sites in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Canada, or its managed hosting and cloud offerings. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and
closing conditions, and is expected to close during the first half of 2017.
Wireline Service and Pr oduct Offerings
We organize our service and product of ferings by the primary customers tar geted by these of ferings – mass markets, global enterprise and global wholesale.
Mass Markets
Mass Marke ts operations provide broadband Inter net and video services (including high-speed Internet, Fios Internet and Fios video services), and local exchange
(basic service and end-user  access) and long distanc e (including regional toll) voice services to residential and small business  subscribers. In 2016, Mass Markets
revenues were $14.4 billion, representing approximately 46% of W ireline’ s aggregate revenues.
Internet services. We offer Fios Internet and high-speed Internet services with varying throughput speeds. We believe that as consumers connect more devices and
stream more video, they will require increased broadband speeds. With our Fios Quantum broadband service and certain other data services, our customers can
achieve symmetrical upload and download speeds of up to 500 Mbps, and we recently launched our Instant Internet service, which allows customers in certain

legacy voice and data services to fiber services, including IP and Ethernet.
Global Wholesale
Global Wholesale provides communications services, including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services, primarily to local, long distance, wireless and
other carriers  that use our facilities to provide services to their customers. In 2016, Global Wholesa le revenues were $5.0 billion, representing approximately 16%
of Wireline’ s aggregate revenues. A portion of Global Wholesale revenues are generated by a few large telecommunications companies, most of which compete
directly with us.
Global Wholesale provides the following services, which it jointly markets with V erizon’ s other business units through V erizon Enterprise Solutions:
 
 • Data services. We offer a robust portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance our whol esale customers’ networks and provide
connections to their end-users  and subscribers. Our data services include high-s peed digital data offerings, such as Ethernet and Wavelength services, as
well as core data circuits , such as DS1s and DS3s. In addition, we receive revenue from data services that is generated from carriers that buy dedicated
local exchange capacity to support their private networks.
Data services also include certain value-added business services, which leverage many of the same of ferings available in the Global Enterprise portfolio,
including:
 
 • Managed services , which offer wholesale customers security , remote access, web applications and the opportunity to outsource the management
of their networks to V erizon;
 
 • Mobility offerings , which enable  wholesale customers to enhance their portfolio to triple-play or quad-play capability by leveraging wireless
devices and services of fered through V erizon W ireless that can be packaged and resold under their own carrier brand; and
 
 • Security services , which provide wholesale customers integrated solutions to help their enterprise end-users  secure their networks and data.
 
 • Voice services. We provide switched access services that allow carriers to complete their end-user  calls that originate or terminate within our territo ry. In
addition, we provide originating and terminatin g voice services throughout the United States and globally utilizing our time-division multiplexing
(TDM) and V oIP networks.
 
 • Local services. We offer an array of local dial tone and broadban d services to competitive local exchange carriers, some of which are offered to comply
with telecommunications  regulations. In addition, we offer services such as colocation, resale and unbundled network elements in compliance with
applicable regulations.
Network
Verizon operates a lar ge and advanced telecommunications network in the United States and around the world to provide services and solutions to its customers.
 
 • Fios. Our fiber-to-the-home  network through which we provide our Fios residential broadband service has passed over 16.9 million premises in the
United State s as of December 31, 2016. Residential broadband service has seen significant growth  in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and
we believe that demand will continue to grow . The continued emer gence of new video services, new data applications and the proliferation of IP devices
in the home will continu e to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network
(PON) techn ology under pinning Fios makes us well positioned to meet these demands in a cost effective and efficient manner . Our PON technology
provides the flexibility to adapt our network to deliver increased data speeds and new services without major overhauls or replacements to the fiber-
optic infrastructure.

Table of Contents
While deployed initially as a consumer broadban d network, the PON infrastructure is also finding  more widespread application in the enterprise sector ,
especially as businesses increasingly migrate to Ethernet-based access services.
 
 • Global IP . Verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiber networks in the world, providing connectivity to business customers in more than
150 countries. Our globa l IP network includes long haul, metro and submarine assets that span over 800,000 route miles and enable and support far
reaching international operations.
Global business is rapidly evolving to an “everything-as-a-service”  model in which business customers seek cloud-based, conver ged enterprise solutions
delivered securely via managed and professional services. With the continued deployment of packet optical transport strategy , Verizon is creating a
single, high-capacity global network platform that combines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology . The result is a global IP
network that can of fer powerful solutions to these service demands.
We believe that our continued focus on enhancin g our domestic and global fiber-based networks, and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology
deployments, will help V erizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential and enterprise customers.
Competition
The wireline  telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify further with traditional, non-traditional  and emer ging players
seeking incre ased market share. Current and potential competitors include cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications
providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers and other companies that of fer network services and managed enterprise solutions.
In addition, companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline busine sses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and
integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale markets. We compete with
these providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition
and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may af fect our future revenue growth.
We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry:
 
 • Bandwidth (speed) and network reliability:  Consumers and small business customers are seeking to leverage high-speed connections for entertainment,
communications and productivity . As online and online-enabled activities increase, so will bandwidth requirements, both downstream and upstream. To
succeed, we and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing bandwidth requirements.  In addition, network
reliability and security are increasingly important  competitive factors in the global enterprise mark et. We continue to invest in our network to be able to
meet growing bandwidth demand and provide the most reliable and secure network.
 
 • Pricing: Cable operators, telecommunications companies and integrated service providers use pricing to capture market share from incumbents. Pricing
is also a significant facto r as non-traditional  modes of providing communication services emer ge and new entrants compete for customers. For example,
VoIP and portal-based calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues.
 
 • Customer service:  Custo mers expect industry-leading service from  their service providers. As technologies and services evolve, the ability to excel in
this area is important for customer acquisition and retention. In Mass Markets, we compete in this area through our service representatives and online
support. In Global Enter prise, we provide our customers with ready access to their system and performance information, and we conduct proactive
testing of our network to identify issues before  they affect customers. In the Global Wholesale business, we believe service improvement can be
achieved through continued system automation initiatives.
 
 • Product differ entiation: As a result of pricing pressures, providers need to differentiate their products and services. Customers are shifting their focus
from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband and video connections. Conver ged features, such as integrated wireless and
wireline functionality , are becoming similarly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement.
 
 • Innovation: The delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating. To compete effectively , providers need to continuously
review , improve and refine their product portfolio and develop and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of the customer .

Table of Contents
In the Mass Markets business, cable operators are significant competitors. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to offer
digital products and services. We continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include high-speed Internet access, digital television and voice services.
Several major cable operators also of fer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships.
We expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility
and wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable companies and other providers of VoIP
services as well as Internet portal providers. In addition, customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services and that content
can be accessed on a TV , computer , tablet or mobile phone.
In the global enterprise market, the customer ’s need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology conver gence is
driving the expansion of the competitive landsca pe. Major competitors include system integrators, carriers and hardware and software providers. Some of the
biggest comp anies in IT services are making strategic acquisitions, divesting non-strategic  assets or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in
technology spending. Many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emer ging fields such as cloud computing, software delivery , communication
applications and other computing tasks via the network, rather than on in-house  machi nes. Carriers have  also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into
enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major IT outsourcers.
Global Who lesale compe tes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for
wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity .
We also compete with competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs). Our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to CLECs at
significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations char ge their retail customers.
 
New Pr oduct Development and Strategic Initiatives
Technology developments, interconnected markets, shifting consumer needs and conver ging industry ecosystems are creating innovative opportunities for
Verizon. We are transform ing around the capabilities of our high-performing networks, with a goal of future growth based on delivering what customers want and
need in the new digital world. Our three tier strategy is to lead at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, develop new business models through
global platforms in digital media and IoT and deliver solutions to key industry segments for incre mental monetization. To execute this strategy , we have created
an organization devoted to the development of new products and the cultivation of new businesses. This organization is focused on leveraging all of our assets to
create innovative products and services that can provide our customers with integrated solutions that address their needs. Several strategic initiatives have been
undertaken by this or ganization in the areas of digital media, interactive entertainment and IoT and telematics products and services.
As a market  leader in offering differentiated solutions to our connected customers across their devices at home, at work and on the go, Verizon will continue to
focus on strategic partnerships as an important pillar of our future strategy . Strategic partnerships are aimed at complementing and augmenting our strengths,
expanding our addressable market, accelerating our pace of innovation, enabling faster delivery of solutions such as media and IoT to the marketplace and, where
possible, lowering our market and execution risk. Strong partnerships are expected to further our efforts to offer comprehensive solutions for our customers. We
look to formulate strate gic partnerships and alliances with a global orientation, which we believe will benefit us in terms of technology sourcing, content
acquisition, consumer insights and application ecosystems.
We believe these investm ents will assist us in bringing innovative next generation products and services to market and uncovering new sources of revenue,
increasing revenue from existing projects and leveraging our strengths across the company .
Digital Media and Interactive Entertainment
Verizon has been investing in emer ging technology that taps into the market shift to digital conte nt and advertising. We have been investing in video assets and
capabilities with a goal of building a global platform and developing new business models for reaching the digital video customer . We believe the growth in video
consumption using mobile devices provides us with an opportunity for revenue growth. Through  various acquisitions and investments and the launch of video
streaming products and services, we are expanding the ways in which we can deliver content to our customers, including the following:
 
 • In June 2015, we completed our acquisition of AOL Inc. (AOL), a leader in digital content and advertising. AOL ’s business model aligns with our
approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a digital advertising platform enhances our ability to
further develop future revenue streams. During 2015, we also acquired Millennial Media, an advertising technology business.
 
 • In July 2016, we entered  into a stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Yahoo ! Inc. (Yahoo). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire the stock of one or more subsidiaries of Yahoo holding all of Yahoo’ s
operating business, for approximately $4.83 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the Transaction). On February 20, 2017, we entered into an
amendment to the Purch ase Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, the Transaction purchase price will be reduced by $350 million to
approximately $4.48 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. The Transaction is expecte d to provide us with a valuable portfolio of online
properties and mobile applications, including market leading content in sports, finance, news and email services, which have attracted over one billion
monthly active consumer  views. The Transaction  is expected to also expand our analytics and ad tech capabilities and enhance our competitive position
and value proposition to advertisers. Additional discussion of the Transaction is included in the 2016 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners in Note 2
to the consolidated financial statements of V erizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report.

 • In 2015, we launched go90, a mobile-first social entertainment platform that provides the opportunity for ad-supported  mobil e video streaming as well
as subscription-based services. Digital content available on the go90 platform includes live events, popular web and television content and original
content. In 2016, we introduced StreamPass, which offers streaming of live sports through go90 free of data charges to Verizon Wireless customers on
certain data plans. We also introduced FreeBee Data, a sponsored data service that enables conte nt providers to provide our customers with access to
some or all of the provider ’s mobile content or to sponsor specific consumer actions on a per-click  basis, free of data char ges to the customer .
 
 • We have made investmen ts in conver ging technol ogies and services involving content delivery networks (CDNs), video streaming and related consumer
hardware to leverage new content models. Our wireless network enables us to move towards a unified video strategy that positions us to take advantage
of this growth opportunity . We began using Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service technology to develop our LTE Multicast service, which we use to
deliver live events in go90. This service has the potential to enhance our network efficiency and provide our customers with access to live streaming
video content with virtua lly no buffering, regardless of the number of devices using the service. We also believe it is important to have rights to deliver
content over a wireless network that do not require an authentication back to a subscription agreement. For example, our NFL agreement allows our
customers to access certain games live on our 4G L TE network without authenticating back to any subscription.
 
 • We continue to invest in Verizon Digital Media Services, which offers a scalable platform for delivering content, including live broadcasts, video on
demand, games, software and websites, to our customers on their devices at any time. As the digital platform reshapes the delivery of media and
entertainment content, there is an increasing need for a stable, high-quality video delivery platfor m. We are focused on providing a simple end-to-end
global platfo rm for the delivery of media to customers, which we believe will be superior to that offered by the existing and highly fragmented media
delivery ecosystem. This platform is targeted at media and entertainment companies and other businesses focused on delivering their digital products
and services through the Internet. W e also expect, through this platform, to further integrate our Fios and wireless of ferings.
 
 • During 2016, we establis hed Verizon Hearst Media Partners, LLC, a content joint venture with Hearst Entertainment & Syndication (Hearst), to build
new multiplatform digital video channels targeted to the mobile millennial audience. In partnership with Hearst, we have also invested in two media
companies, AwesomenessTV Holdings, LLC and Complex Media, Inc. & CM Partners, LLC, which are leaders in producing content targeted at key
demographics, in order to further diversify our content and distribution businesses within our digital media portfolio.
Internet of Things and T elematics
The adoption  of IoT technology continues to grow as companies across a wide range of industries are leveraging IoT technologies to increase efficiency , gain
better custom er insights, facilitate compliance with regulations and build new business models. Although IoT growth is expanding broadly , adoption is
particularly strong in the telematics and transport ation industries, as well as the fields of smart communities, healthcare, utilities and energy management. We are
building our growth capabilities in the IoT market by developing business models that monetize usage on our network at the connectivity , platform and solution
layers. For example, we have developed IoT solutions that address key market needs for electr ic and other utilities, farms and other purveyors of food and
agriculture, drug companies and others with complex supply chains. In addition, our IoT custom ers can turn the data that our solutions provide into actionable
opportunities to develop new services and create revenue growth.
Our strategy to simplify IoT technology and accelerate its adoption also includes ThingSpace, an IoT platform. ThingSpace is designed to help developers create,
test, manage and market IoT-based  solutions aimed at major vertical markets, such as energy, health care and connected cities. Thin gSpace comes with a portal
that includes immediate access to dedicated application programming interfaces and partner development kits. In October 2016, we acquired Sensity Systems,
Inc., a leading provider of IoT solutions for smart communities, in order to add a leading comprehensive suite of smart city solutions.
Through Verizon Telema tics, we provide connec tivity and telematics services and applications to manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz  and help businesses
manage large vehicle fleets more efficiently . Our suite of real-time vehicle communications servic es and applications connects automobiles with content services
and call centers. Our platform enables factory and aftermarket-installed automotive safety and security features as well as location-based services and vehicle
diagnostics. We provide usage-based data services to new vehicles in the United States, China and Europe. Our Verizon Telematics solution provides commercial
fleet managers throughout North America with real-time access to data that yields operational efficiencies, increased vehicle reliability and improved driver
safety . We also provide this service to over 23,000 vehicles operated by V erizon.
In 2015, we introduced hum, an aftermarket vehicle technology and subscription service. This subscription-based service provides consumers with diagnostic
technology in their vehicles, access to live assistance and roadside assistance with GPS accuracy when needed. Our hum service also offers the ability to connect
with a certified mechanic to diagnose potential problems and of fer solutions.
In 2016, we acquired Fleetmatics Group PLC, a global provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions, and Telogis, Inc., a global, cloud-based
mobile enter prise management software company . We expect these acquisitions to advance our fleet telematics solutions, expand our distribution relationships
and position our telematics business as a leading provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions globally .

Patents, T rademarks and Licenses
We own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We
actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the
United States and abroa d. We also actively grant licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and
restrictions, to other companies that enable them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and
services. Such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage of the results of Verizon’ s research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable
consideration being paid to us, we do not believe that the loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a
material ef fect on our results of operations.
We periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other
payments. We also perio dically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These
claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to
pay damages or royalties, or cease of fering the relevant products or services.
 
Acquisitions and Divestitur es
Information about our acquisitions and divestitures is included in the 2016 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners under the heading “Management’ s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Acquisitions and Divestitures”, which is incorporated by reference into this report.
 
Regulatory and Competitive T rends
Regulatory and Competitive Landscape
Verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market. Current and potential competitor s include other voice and data service providers such as other
wireless companies, traditional telephone companies, cable companies, Internet service providers, software and application providers, and other non-traditional
companies. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing  customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying
competition that may affect our future revenue growth. Some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services
offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator . The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act or Act). Other V erizon services are subject to state and local regulation.
Federal Regulation
Wireless Services
The FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally , the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition and transfer of
wireless communication s systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC
oversight. Verizon anticip ates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. We can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or
leasing spect rum from others, or by participating  in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain
reviews, approvals and potential conditions.
Today , Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and data
services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of
Verizon’ s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide
services on the spectrum  covered by that license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called  “open access” FCC regulations, which generally
require licen sees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has
also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards,
provision of enhanced 91 1 services, roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities.
Broadband
Verizon of fers many dif ferent broadband services. T raditionally , the FCC recognized that broadband Internet access services as “information services” subject to a
“light touch” regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. In 2015, the FCC reversed course and declared that broadband Internet
access servic es are “telecommunications service s” subject to common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. This decision created
uncertainty concerning the level of regulation that will apply to broadband services. It created a risk that such regulation would limit the ways that broadband
Internet access service providers structure their business arrangements and manage their networks and could spur additional restrictions, including rate regulation,
that could adversely affect broadband investment and innovation. The FCC’ s decision was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals, but may be subject to
further challenge in the courts. In addition, Cong ress and the FCC are likely to continue to debate the proper scope of such regulations. Regardless of regulation,
Verizon remains committed to the open Internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when,
where, and how they want, and our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at http://responsibility .verizon.com/broadband-commitment.

Wireline V oice
Verizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as VoIP. For
regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be “common carrier” services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened
regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP
but has said V oIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 91 1 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements.
Video
Verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these
rules also generally apply to V erizon. In areas where V erizon of fers its facilities-based multichannel video services, V erizon has typically been required to obtain a
franchise from local authorities.
Privacy and Data Security
We are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business, including voice,
wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in the IoT space. At the federal level, much of our business is subject to the
FCC’ s privac y and data security requirements. In November 2016, the FCC released new privacy and data security rules that will apply to all telecommunications
services, including our fixed and mobile voice and broadband services. Other parts of our business are subject to the privacy and data security oversight of other
federal regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission. Generally , attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at both the state and
federal level. In addition, a new data protection regulation will go into ef fect in Europe in May 2018 that includes significant penalties for non-compliance.
Public Safety and Cybersecurity
The FCC has played a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emer gency commun ications services and mandating widespread availability of both
media (broa dcast/cable) and wireless emer gency alerting services. In response to recent cyber attacks, however , the FCC or other regulators may attempt to
increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers.
Inter carrier Compensation and Network Access
The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks
and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline “business
data services” and other  services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection
payments. The FCC has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates, terms and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data
services may be appropriate.
State Regulation and Local Regulation
Wireless Services
The Act generally preem pts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates  charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does not prohibit states
from regulat ing the other “terms and conditions”  of wireless service. For example, some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose
reporting requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving) and taxation matters.
In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified
facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process.
Wireline Services
State public utility commissions regulate Verizon’ s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an
“incumbent local exchange carrier” in nine states  and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and
other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated. In addition, as a video services operator in many
states, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply with certain
one-time  and ongoing obligations, as a result.

Envir onmental Matters
Reserves have been established to cover environm ental matters relating to discontinued businesses  and past telecommunications activities. These reserves include
funds to address contamination at the site of a former Sylvania facility in Hicksville, NY, which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. In
September 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken
primary responsibility for addressing the contami nation at the site. An adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to
the past and future expen ses of all of the parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites
requiring remediation.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors
The followin g discussion of “Risk Factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or futur e
performance. This information should be read in conjunction with “Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations”
and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are
important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our futur e results to differ materially from our historical
results and fr om expectations r eflected in forwar d-looking statements.
Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations.
Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and
demand for some of our products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of
our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining lower -cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly , under these
conditions, the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In
addition, adverse econom ic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these
events were to occur , it could have a material adverse ef fect on our results of operations.
We face significant competition that may reduce our profits.
We face significant competition in our industry . The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the traditional
distinctions among wireless, cable, Internet, local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other
telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, applicatio n and device providers and providers of VoIP services. While
these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive
offerings. In addition, wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relations hips with their customers through commercial offers that vary
service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting Verizon Wireless customers. Our ability to
compete effectively will depend on, among other  things, our network quality , capacity and covera ge, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our
customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital
resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry , including new technologies and business
models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to respond
successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits.
If we are not able to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology and address changing cons umer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline
in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits.
Our industry  is rapidly changing as new techno logies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new
entrants into the markets we serve. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology , enhance our existing offerings
and introduc e new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely
basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new
services in the market. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services. If our services fail to gain acceptance in the
marketplace, or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these services mate rially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could
be adversely af fected.
In addition to introducing  new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprof itable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a
cost-ef fective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services.
We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business.
We depend on various key suppliers and vendor s to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as switch and network
equipment, smartphones and other wireless devices, that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. For example, our
smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. If
these suppliers or vendo rs fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide
products and services as and when requested by our customers. We also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the cost and
time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another , our business could  be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to,
replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on
short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.
The suppliers and vendo rs on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving
claims of patent infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry . We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by
any such litigation. W e expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology .

Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely af fect our business prospects or results of operations.
Our domestic operations are subject to regulation  by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various
foreign gove rnments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and
provide specified products or services. We are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with
prescribed standards. We are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is
impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or
state courts of regulatory  rulings. Without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and
services. Similarly , we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses neede d to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing
licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of
our licenses could have a material adverse ef fect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
New laws or regulations or changes to the existin g regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level could restrict the ways in which we
manage our wireline and wireless networks, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a
manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. For example, we are subject to federal, state and international laws related to privacy and data
protection. A new data protection regulation will go into effect in Europe in May 2018 that inclu des significant penalties for non-compliance.  In addition, in its
order imposing so-called  “network neutrality” regulations, the FCC reversed course in 2015 on the longstanding “light touch” approach and “reclassified”
broadband Internet access services as telecommu nications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. While the full scope and effect of this
new regulato ry approach  is uncertain, these rules limit the ways that a broadband Internet access service provider can structure business arrangements, manage its
network and open the door to additional restrictions, including rate regulation that could adversely  affect broadband investment and innovation. These rules may
be subject to further challenge in the courts and the proper scope of such regulations is being debated in Congress and the FCC, but the outcome and timing of
those challenges and debates remain uncertain. As another example, we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called  “open access” FCC
regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. Moreover , certain services
could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and
introducing new services. The further regulation  of broadband, wireless and our other activitie s and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to
compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks.
Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse ef fect on our business.
Cyber attack s, including through the use of malw are, computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, credential harvesting and other means for obtaining
unauthorized access to or disrupting the operatio n of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an
adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or
employees or valuable technical and marketing  information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ operations. Cyber attacks against companies,
including Verizon, have increased in frequency , scope and potential harm in recent years. Further , the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular
groups or persons. Thes e attacks may be committed by company employees or external actors operating in any geography , including jurisdictions where law
enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective, and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states. While, to date, we
have not been subject to cyber attacks which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions
we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insuf ficient to repel or mitigate the effects of
a major cyber attack in the future.
The inability  to operate our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited
period of time, may result in significant expenses  to Verizon and/or a loss of market share to other communications providers. The costs associated with a major
cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on
cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption  and litigation. The potential costs associated with these attacks
could exceed  the insurance coverage we maintain. Further , certain of Verizon’ s businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud
services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own netw orks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber
attack. More over, our increasing presence in the IoT industry with offerings of telematics products and services, including vehicle telematics, could also increase
our exposure to potential  costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services. In addition, a compromise
of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information, such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information, could result in lawsuits
and government claims, investigations or proceedings. Any of these occurrences could damage our reputation, adversely impact customer and investor
confidence, and could further result in a material adverse ef fect on V erizon’ s results of operation or financial condition.
Natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations.
Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. Such
events could cause signi ficant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations  rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our
customers. While we maintain insurance covera ge for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance
coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy may be inef fective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery
 
19
Table of Contents
planning may not be sufficient for all eventualiti es. These events could also damage the infrastru cture of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and
services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could
cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. In addition, these occurrences could result
in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation.
Verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if V erizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt.
As of Decem ber 31, 2016, Verizon had approximately $108.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness, as well as approximately $8.9 billion of unused borrowing
capacity under its existing credit facility . Verizon’ s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:
 
 • requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt and
the preferred stock issued by an entity acquired  in a transaction with Vodafone, which would reduce the funds Verizon has available for other
purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions;
 
 • making it more difficult  or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes;
 
 • reducing V erizon’ s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industry and market conditions;
 
 • making V erizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and
 
 • exposing V erizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that its debt obligations are at variable interest rates.
In addition, our term loan agreements require Verizon to maintain a certain leverage ratio unless  Verizon’ s credit ratings are at or above a certain level, which
could limit V erizon’ s ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
Adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing.
We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit
markets. Adverse change s in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to
obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our borrowi ng costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings
assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance  as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these
ratings woul d likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets
could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also af fect our access to financing.
Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments.
With approximately 160,900 employees and approximately 201,000 retirees as of December 31, 2016 eligible to participate in V erizon’ s benefit plans, the costs of
pension bene fits and active and retiree healthcar e benefits have a significant impact on our profitability . Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future
funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding the potential repeal and
replacement or modification of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our
pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes  in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If
we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments.
A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the
renegotiation of our labor contracts.
As of Decem ber 31, 2016, approximately 23% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. While less than 1% of the workforce of our wireless and other
businesses outside of wireline are represented by unions, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing these workforces or the
potentially negative impact it would have on our costs.
We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements.
We are subject to a subst antial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder deriv ative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions,
wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless
business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and
class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adve rse health effects of handheld wireless phones. We may incur
significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements.

improvements, central office buildings or any other buildings that house network equipmen t, and buildings that are used for administrative and other
purposes. Substantially all the switching centers are located on land and in buildings we own due to their critical role in the network and high set-up  relocation
costs. We also maintain facilities throughout the United States comprised of administrative and sales offices, customer care centers, retail sales locations, garage
work centers , switching centers, cell sites and data centers. Furniture and other consists of telephone equipment, furniture, data processing equipment, office
equipment, motor vehicles, plant under construction and leasehold improvements.
 
Item 3.    Legal Proceedings
In October 2013, the California Attorney General’ s Office notified Verizon California Inc. and other Verizon companies of potential violations of California state
hazardous waste statutes primarily arising from  the disposal of electronic components, batteries and aerosol cans at certain California facilities. We are
cooperating with this investigation and continue to review our operations relating to the management of hazardous waste. While penalties relating to the alleged
violations could exceed $100,000, we do not expect that any penalties ultimately incurred will be material. On April 1, 2016, we completed the sale to Frontier of
our landline business operated by Verizon Califo rnia Inc. and certain other Verizon landline companies. As a result of this transaction, Frontier now owns and
operates V erizon California Inc. and has assumed the liabilities of V erizon California Inc. that may arise as a result of these alleged violations.

Stock Repur chases
In March 2014, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a three-year share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of the Company’ s common
stock. Under the program, shares may be repurch ased in privately negotiated transactions and on the open market, including through plans complying with Rule
10b5-1(c)  under the Exchange Act. The timing and number of shares purchased under the program, if any, will depend on market conditions and the Company’ s
capital allocation priorities.
During the fourth quarter  of 2016, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon common stock. At December 31, 2016, the maximum number of shares that
could be purchased by or on behalf of V erizon under our share buyback program was 97.2 million.

to the registr ant which is required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized  and reported within required time periods using the criteria for
effective internal control established in Interna l Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the registrant’ s disclosure controls and
procedures were ef fective as of December 31, 2016.
In the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes that
are intended to ensure an effective internal contr ol environment. There were no changes in the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting during the
fourth quarter of 2016 that have materially af fected, or are reasonably likely to materially af fect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’ s report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of V erizon’ s independent registered public accounting firm are included
in the 2016 V erizon Annual Report to Shareowners and are incorporated herein by reference.

Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
Overview
Verizon Com munications Inc. (Verizon, or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’ s leading providers of
communications, inform ation and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies. With a presence around the world,
we offer voice, data and video services and solutions on our wireless and wireline networks that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility , reliable
network connectivity , security and control. We have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline. Our wireless business, operating as Verizon Wireless,
provides voice and data services and equipment sales across the United States (U.S.) using one of the most extensive and reliable wireless networks. Our wireline
business provides consumer , business and gover nment customers with communications products and enhanced services, including broadband data and video,
corporate networking solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services, and also owns
and operates one of the most expansive end-to-end  Globa l Internet Protoco l (IP) networks. We have a highly skilled, diverse and dedicated workforce of
approximately 160,900 employees as of December 31, 2016.
To compete effectively in today’ s dynamic marke tplace, we are focused on transforming around the capabilities of our high-performing networks with a goal of
future growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the new digital world. Our three tier strategy is to lead at the network connectivity level in the
markets we serve, develop new business models through global platforms in video and the Internet of Things (IoT) and create certain opportunities in applications
and content for incremental monetization. Our strategy requires significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into
service, provide addition al capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the fiber-optic network that supports our businesses, maintain our networks and develop
and maintain significant advanced information technology systems and data system capabilities. We believe that steady and consistent investments in our
networks and platforms will drive innovative products and services and fuel our growth. In additio n, protecting the privacy of our customers’ information and the
security of our systems and networks will continu e to be a priority at Verizon. Our network leader ship will continue to be the hallmark of our brand, and provide
the fundamental strength at the connectivity , platform and solutions layers upon which we build our competitive advantage.
Strategic T ransactions
Digital Media and Interactive Entertainment
We have been investing in technology that taps into the market shift to digital content and advertising. During 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the Merger Agre ement) with AOL Inc. (AOL) pursuant to which we completed a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of
AOL at a price of $50.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicab le withholding taxes. The aggregate cash consideration paid by
Verizon at the closing of these transactions was approximately $3.8 billion. AOL is a leader in the digital content and advertising platform space. AOL ’s business
model aligns with this approach, and we believe  that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a digital advertising platform enhances our
ability to further develop future revenue streams.
On July 23, 2016, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire the stock of one or more subsidiaries of Yahoo holding all of Yahoo’ s operating
business, for approximately $4.83 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the Transaction). On February 20, 2017, Verizon and Yahoo entered into an
amendment to the Purchase Agreement, pursuant  to which the Transaction purchase price will be reduced by $350 million to approximately $4.48 billion in cash,
subject to certain adjustments. Subject to certain exceptions, the parties also agreed that certain user security and data breaches incurred by Yahoo (and the losses
arising there from) will be disregarded (1) for purposes of specified conditions to Verizon’ s obliga tions to close the Transaction and (2) in determining whether a
“Business Material Adverse Ef fect” under the Purchase Agreement has occurred.
Concurrently with the amendment of the Purchas e Agreement, Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Yahoo that Verizon has agreed to
purchase pursuant to the Transaction, also entered  into an amendment to a related reorganization agreement, pursuant to which Yahoo (which has announced that
it intends to change its name to Altaba Inc. following the closing of the Transaction) will retain 50% of certain post-closing liabilities arising out of governmental
or third party investigations, litigations or other claims related to certain user security and data breaches incurred by Yahoo. In accordance with the original
Transaction agreements,  Yahoo will continue to retain 100% of any liabilities arising out of any shareholder lawsuits (including derivative claims) and
investigations and actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The Transac tion remains subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of Yahoo’ s stockholders, and is expected to close in the second quarter
of 2017.
We believe that our acquisition of Yahoo’ s operating business will help us become a scaled distributor in mobile media. Yahoo’ s operations are expected to
provide us with a valuab le portfolio of online content, mobile applications and viewers. Additiona lly, our acquisition of Yahoo’ s operating business is expected to
expand our analytics and ad tech capabilities which we expect will enhance both our competitive position in the mobile media marketplace and value proposition
to advertisers (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details).
 
IoT and T elematics
We are also building our growth capabilities in the emer ging IoT market by developing business models to monetize usage on our network at the connectivity and
platform layers. On July 30, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Fleetmatics Group PLC (Fleetmatics), a leading global provider of fleet and
mobile workforce management solutions. Pursua nt to the terms of the agreement, we acquired Fleetmatics for $60.00 per ordinary share in cash. The aggregate
merger consideration was approximately $2.5 billion, including cash acquired of $0.1 billion. We completed the acquisition on November 7, 2016. In July 2016,
we also closed on the acquisition of Telogis, Inc. (Telogis), a global cloud-based mobile enterprise management software business, for $0.9 billion of cash
consideration. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized IoT revenues, including revenues from businesses acquired during 2016, of approximately
$1.0 billion, a 39% increase compared to the prior year period.
Network Evolution
We are reinventing our network architecture around a common fiber platform that will support both our wireless and wireline technologies. We expect that this
new “One Fiber” architecture will improve our 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of fifth-generation  (5G) technology , deliver high-speed Fios broadb and
to homes and businesses and create new opportun ities in the small and medium business market. In April 2016, we announced our One Fiber strategy for the city
of Boston. We launched One Fiber for consumer and business services to customers in Boston late in 2016. We expect to have further opportunities for expansion
with our acquisition of XO Holdings’ wireline business, which owns and operates one of the largest fiber-based IP and Ethernet networks, for approximately
$1.8 billion, subject to adjustment. W e completed this acquisition on February 1, 2017.
Data Center Sale
On Decembe r 6, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with Equinix, Inc. (Equinix) pursuant to which Verizon will sell 24 customer -facing data center
sites in the United States  and Latin America, for approximately $3.6 billion, subject to certain adjustments. The sale does not affect Verizon’ s data center services
delivered from 27 sites in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Canada, or its managed hosting and cloud  offerings. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory
approvals and closing conditions, and is expected to close during the first half of 2017.
Access Line Sale
On February 5, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier Communications Corp oration (Frontier) pursuant to which Verizon agreed to sell its
local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access
lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states, for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.3 billion net of
income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier (Access Line Sale). The
transaction, which included the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon’ s incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and
Texas, did not involve any assets or liabilities of V erizon W ireless. The transaction closed on April 1, 2016.
The transaction resulted in Frontier acquiring approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video
subscribers and the related ILEC businesses from Verizon. Approximately 9,300 Verizon empl oyees who served customers in California, Florida and Texas
continued employment with Frontier . The operati ng results of these businesses, collectively , are excluded from our Wireline segment for all periods presented to
reflect comparable segment operating results consistent with the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker .
Business Overview
In the sections that follo w, we provide information about the important aspects of our operations and investments, both at the consolidated and segment levels,
and discuss our results of operations, financial position and sources and uses of cash. We have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate
and manage as strategic business units and or ganize by products and services.
Wireless
Our Wireles s segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications services and products across one of the most extensive wireless
networks in the United States. We provide these services and equipment sales to consumer , business and government customers in the United States on a postpaid
and prepaid basis. Postpaid connections represen t individual lines of service for which a customer is billed in advance a monthly access charge in return for a
monthly network service allowance, and usage beyond the allowance is billed monthly in arrea rs. Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless
services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance.
We offer various postpai d account service plans, including shared data plans, single connection plans and other plans tailored to the needs of our customers. Our
shared data plans typical ly feature domestic unlimited voice minutes, unlimited domestic and international text, video and picture messaging, and a single data
allowance that can be shared among the wireless devices on a customer ’s account. These allowances will vary from time to time as part of promotional offers or
in response to market circumstances. On February 12, 2017, we announced an introductory plan, our new Verizon Unlimited plan, available to our consumer and
small busine ss customers, which offers among other things, unlimited domestic voice, data and texting. Both our shared data plans and the Verizon Unlimited
plan include our HD (High Definition) V oice, V ideo Calling and Mobile Hotspot services on compatible devices.
Under the Verizon devic e payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase wireless devices under a device payment plan agreement. Customers that
activate service on devices purchased under the device payment program, or on a compatible device that they already own, pay lower service fees (unsubsidized
service pricing) as compared to those under fixed-term service plans.
We are focusing our wireless capital spending on adding capacity and density to our fourth-generation (4G) Long-T erm Evolution (LTE) network, which is
available to over 98% of the U.S. population in more than 500 markets covering approximately 314 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in
Rural Ameri ca partners. Approximately 96% of our total data traffic in December 2016 was carried on our 4G LTE network. We are investing in the densification
of our network by utilizing small cell technology , in-building  solutions and distributed antenna systems. Densification enables us to add capacity to manage
mobile video consumption and demand for IoT, as well as position us for future 5G technology . We are committed to developing and deploying 5G wireless
technology . We are working with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development and appropriate requirements for this next
generation of wireless technology . Based on the outcome of our ongoing pre-commercial  trials, we intend to be the first company to deploy a 5G fixed wireless
broadband network in the United States. W e expect to launch a fixed commercial wireless service supported by this network in 2018.
Wireline
Our W ireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services, including broadband video and data, corporate networking
solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and
services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and around the world.
In our Wireline business, to compensate for the shrinking market for traditional voice service, we continue to build our Wireline segment around data, video and
advanced business servic es – areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing.  We expect our One Fiber initiative in Wireline will allow us to
densify our 4G LTE wireless network as well as position us for future 5G technology . We also continue to seek ways to increase revenue and further realize
operating and capital ef ficiencies as well as maximize profitability for our Fios services.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other includes the results of our digital media, including AOL, telematics and other businesses, investments in unconsolidated businesses,
unallocated corporate expenses, pension and other employee benefit related costs and lease financing. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of
divested operations and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assess ing segment performance due to their non-operational  nature.
Although such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses that are not
individually significant are included in all segment results as these items are included in the chief operating decision maker ’s assessment of segment performance.
On April 1, 2016, we completed the Access Line Sale. On July 1, 2014, our Wireline segment sold a non-strategic  busine ss. See “Acquisiti ons and Divestitures”.
The results of operations for these divestitures are included within Corporate and other for all periods presented to reflect comparable segment operating results
consistent with the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker (See “Impact of Divested Operations”).
In addition, Corporate and other includes the results of our telematics businesses for all periods presented, which were reclassified from our Wireline segment
effective April 1, 2016. The impact of this reclassification was not material to our consolidated financial statements or our segment results of operations.
Capital Expenditur es and Investments
We continue to invest in our wireless network, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the center of growth trends for the future.
During 2016, these investments included $17.1 billion for capital expenditures. See “Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities” and “Operating Environment and
Trends” for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at expanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an
efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing in the information economy .
Consolidated Results of Operations
In this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight items of a non-operational  nature that are not included in our segment results. In
“Segment Results of Operations,” we review the performance of our two reportable segments in more detail.

2016 Compar ed to 2015
The decrease  in consolidated revenues during 2016 was primarily due to a decline in revenues at our segments, Wireless and Wireline, as well as a decline in
revenues within Corporate and other .
Wireless’ revenues decreased $2.5 billion, or 2.7%, during 2016 primarily as a result of a decline in service revenue driven by customer migration to plans with
unsubsidized service pricing, including our new price plans launched during 2016. This decline was partially offset by an increase in other revenue, primarily due
to financing revenues from the Verizon device payment program, and an increase in equipment revenue due to an increase in device sales, primarily smartphones,
under the V erizon device payment program.
Wireline’ s revenues decreased $0.7 billion, or 2.3%, during 2016 primarily as a result of declines in Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale. Wireline’ s revenues
were also partially impac ted by a reduction in Fios marketing activities during the union work stoppage that commenced on April 13, 2016 and ended on June 1,
2016.
Revenues for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Results of Operations”.
Corporate and other revenues decreased $2.1 billion, or 23.0%, during 2016 as a result of the Access Line Sale that was completed on April 1, 2016. The results
of operations related to these divestitures included within Corporate and other are discussed separately below under the heading “Impact of Divested Operations”.
During 2016, our digital media business represented approximately 46% of revenues in Corporate  and other , comprised primarily of revenues from AOL, which
we acquired on June 23, 2015. Corporate and other also includes revenues from new businesses acquired during 2016 of approximately $0.1 billion.
2015 Compar ed to 2014
The increase in consolid ated revenues during 2015 was primarily due to higher equipment revenu es in our Wireless segment, higher revenues as a result of the
acquisition of AOL and higher Mass Markets revenues driven by Fios services at our Wireline segment. Partially offsetting these increases were lower service
revenues at our W ireless segment and lower Global Enterprise revenues at our W ireline segment.
Wireless’ revenues increased $4.0 billion, or 4.6%, during 2015 primarily as a result of growth in equipment revenue. Equipment revenue increased as a result of
an increase in device sales, primarily smartphones, under the Verizon device payment program, partially offset by a decline in device sales under traditional fixed-
term service  plans. Service revenue decreased during 2015 primarily driven by an increase in the activation of devices purchased under the Verizon device
payment program on plans with unsubsidized service pricing.
Wireline’ s revenues decreased $0.7 billion, or 2.1%, during 2015 primarily as a result of declines in Global Enterprise, partially offset by higher Mass Markets
revenues driven by Fios services.
Revenues for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Results of Operations”.
Corporate and other revenues increased $1.3 billion, or 16.6%, during 2015 primarily as a result of the acquisition of AOL, which was completed on June 23,
2015. Corpo rate and other revenues include the results of our local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas that was sold
on April 1, 2016. The results of operations related to these divestitures included within Corpora te and other are discussed separately below under the heading
“Impact of Divested Operations”.

Consolidated operating expenses increased durin g 2016 primarily due to non-operational  charges recorded in 2016 as compared to the non-operational  credits
recorded in 2015 (see “Other Items”). Consolidated operating expenses decreased during 2015  primarily due to non-operational  credits recorded in 2015 as
compared to non-operational  char ges recorded in 2014 (see “Other Items”).
Operating expenses for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Results of Operations”.
2016 Compar ed to 2015
Cost of Services
Cost of services include s the following costs directly attributable to a service: salaries and wages, benefits, materials and supplies, content costs, contracted
services, network access and transport costs, customer provisioning costs, computer systems suppo rt, and costs to support our outsourcing contracts and technical
facilities. Aggregate customer care costs, which  include billing and service provisioning, are allocated between Cost of services and Selling, general and
administrative expense.
Cost of services decrease d during 2016 primarily  due to the completion of the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016 (see “Impact of Divested Operations”), as well
as a decline in net pension and postretirement benefit cost in our Wireline segment. Partially offsetting this decrease is an increase in costs as a result of the
acquisition of AOL on June 23, 2015, the launch of go90 in the third quarter of 2015, and $0.4 billion of incremental costs incurred as a result of the union work
stoppage that commenced on April 13, 2016, and ended on June 1, 2016.
Wireless Cost of Equipment
Wireless cost of equipment decreased during 2016 primarily as a result of a 4.6% decline in the number of smartphone units sold, partially offset by an increase in
the average cost per unit for smartphones.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, general and administrative expense includes: salaries and wages and benefits not directly attributable to a service or product, bad debt char ges, taxes other
than income  taxes, advertising and sales commission costs, customer billing, call center and information technology costs, regulatory fees, professional service
fees, and rent and utilities for administrative space. Also included is a portion of the aggregate customer care costs as discussed in “Cost of Services” above.
Selling, general and administrative expense increased during 2016 primarily due to severance, pension and benefit charges recorded in 2016 as compared to
severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2015 (see “Other Items”), an increase in costs as a result of the acquisition of AOL on June 23, 2015, and the
launch of go90 in the third quarter of 2015. These increases were partially offset by a gain on the Access Line Sale (see “Other Items”), a decline in costs as a
result of the completion of the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016 (see “Impact of Divested Opera tions”) as well as declines in sales commission expense at our
Wireless segment and declines in employee costs at our W ireline segment.
Depr eciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased during 2016 primarily due to a decrease in net depreciable assets at our Wireline segment, partially offset by an
increase in depreciable assets at our W ireless segment.
2015 Compar ed to 2014
Cost of Services
Cost of services increased during 2015 primarily due to an increase in costs as a result of the acqu isition of AOL, higher rent expense as a result of an increase in
wireless macro and small cell sites, higher wireless network costs from an increase in fiber facilities supporting network capacity
expansion and densification, including the deplo yment of small cell technology , a volume-driven increase in costs related to the wireless device protection
package offered to our customers as well as a $0.4 billion increase in content costs at our Wireline  segment. Partially offsetting these increases were a $0.4 billion
decline in employee costs and a $0.3 billion decline in access costs at our Wireline segment. Also offsetting the increase was a decrease in Cost of services
reflected in the results of operations related to a non-strategic  Wireline business that was divested on July 1, 2014.
Wireless Cost of Equipment
Wireless cost of equipment increased during 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in the average cost per unit, driven by a shift to higher priced units in the
mix of devices sold, partially of fset by a decline in the number of units sold.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased during 2015 primarily due to non-operational  credit s, primarily severance, pension and benefit credits,
recorded in 2015 as compared to non-operational  charges, primarily severance, pension and benefit charges, recorded in 2014 (see “Other Items”). Also
contributing to this decrease was a decline in sales commission expense at our Wireless segment, which was driven by an increase in activations under the
Verizon device payment program. The decrease is partially offset by an increase in bad debt expe nse at our Wireless segment. The increase in bad debt expense
was primarily driven by a volume increase in our installment receivables, as the credit quality of our customers remained consistent throughout the periods
presented.
Depr eciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased  during 2015 primarily due to $0.9 billion of depreciation and amortization expense not being recorded on our
depreciable Wireline assets in California, Florida and Texas which were classified as held for sale as of February 5, 2015, partially offset by an increase in
depreciable assets at our W ireless segment.
We did not record depreciation and amortization  expense on our depreciable Wireline assets in California, Florida and Texas through the closing of the Access
Line Sale, which closed on April 1, 2016.
Non-operational  Charges (Cr edits)
Non-operational  char ges (credits) included in operating expenses (see “Other Items”) were as follows:

Total non-operating  charges (cr edits) included in operating expenses   $    1,774    $(2,510 )  $    7,134   
     
See “Other Items” for a description of these and other non-operational  items.
Impact of Divested Operations
On April 1, 2016, we completed the Access Line Sale. On July 1, 2014, our Wireline segment sold a non-strategic  busine ss. See “Acquisiti ons and Divestitures”.
The results of operations  related to these divestitures are included within Corporate and other for all periods presented to reflect comparable segment operating
results consi stent with the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker . The results of operations related to these divestitures included

Other Consolidated Results
Equity in (Losses) Earnings of Unconsolidated Businesses
Equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated businesses changed unfavorably by $1.9 billion during 2015 primarily due to the gain of $1.9 billion recorded on the
sale of our interest in Vodafone Omnitel N.V. (the Omnitel Transaction, and such interest, the Omnitel Interest) during the first quarter of 2014, which was part of
the consideration for the acquisition of Vodafone Group Plc’s (Vodafone) indirect 45% interes t in Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless (the Wireless
Transaction) completed on February 21, 2014.

The change in Other income and (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the similar period in 2015 was primarily driven by net
early debt redemption costs of $1.8 billion recorded during the second quarter of 2016. Other income and (expense), net changed favorably during 2015 primarily
driven by net early debt redemption costs of $1.4 billion incurred in 2014 (see “Other Items”).

Total interes t costs on debt balances decreased during 2016 primarily due to lower average debt balances and a lower effective interest rate. Total interest costs on
debt balances increased during 2015 primarily due to a $4.9 billion increase in average debt (see “Consolidated Financial Condition”).
Capitalized interest costs  were higher in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to an increase in wireless licenses that are currently under development, which was a result
of our winning bid in the FCC spectrum license auction during 2015. The FCC granted us those wireless licenses on April 8, 2015 (see Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements for additional details).

The effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income taxes. The effective income tax
rate for 2016 was 35.2% compared to 34.9% for 2015. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the impact of $527 million included in
the provision  for income taxes from goodwill not deductible for tax purposes in connection with the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016. This increase was
partially offset by the impact that lower income before income taxes in the current period has on each of the reconciling items specified in the table included in
Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to lower income before income taxes due to
severance, pension and benefit char ges recorded in 2016 compared to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2015.
The effective income tax rate for 2015 was 34.9% compared to 21.7% for 2014. The increase in the effective income tax rate and provision for income taxes was
primarily due to the impact of higher income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2015 compared to severance, pension
and benefit charges recorded in 2014, as well as tax benefits associated with the utilization of certain tax credits in 2014 in connection with the Omnitel
Transaction. The 2014 effective income tax rate also included a benefit from the inclusion of income attributable to Vodafone’ s noncontrolling interest in the
Verizon W ireless partnership prior to the W ireless T ransaction completed on February 21, 2014.
A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for each period is included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial
statements.

The decrease in Net income attributable to nonco ntrolling interests during 2015 was primarily due to the completion of the Wireless Transaction on February 21,
2014. As a result, our results reflect our 55% ownership interest of Verizon Wireless through the closing of the Wireless Transaction and reflect our full
ownership of Verizon Wireless thereafter . The noncontrolling interests that remained after the completion of the Wireless Transaction primarily relate to wireless
partnership entities.
 
Consolidated Net Income, Operating Income and EBITDA
Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (Consolidated EBITDA) and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which are
presented below, are non-GAAP  meas ures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating
operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and
acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon’ s competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated
by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income and (expense),
net to net income.
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding the effect of non-operational  items and the impact of divested operations from the calculation of
Consolidated EBITDA. We believe this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of
our operations and unde rlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’ s evaluation of business performance. We believe Consolidated
Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to compare a company’ s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in
capital struct ure, taxes and depreciation policies.  Further , the exclusion of non-operational  items and the impact of divested operations enables comparability to
prior period performance and trend analysis. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is also used by rating agencies, lenders and other parties to evaluate our
creditworthiness. See “Other Items” for additional details regarding these non-operational  items.
Operating expenses include pension and other postretirement benefit related credits and/or charges based on actuarial assumptions, including projected discount
rates and an estimated return on plan assets. Such estimates are updated at least annually at the end of the fiscal year to reflect actual return on plan assets and
updated actuarial assumptions or more frequently  if significant events arise which require an interim remeasurement. The adjustment has been recognized in the
income statement during the fourth quarter or upon a remeasurement event pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains/losses. We
believe the exclusion of these actuarial gains or losses enables management, investors and other users of our financial information to assess our performance on a
more comparable basis and is consistent with management’ s own evaluation of performance.
It is manage ment’ s inten t to provide non-GAAP  financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon’ s GAAP financial information, and it should be
considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP . Each non-GAAP  financ ial measure is
presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP  measure. We believe that
non-GAAP  measures provide relevant and useful informatio n, which is used by management, investors and other users of our financial information as well as by
our managem ent in assessing both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP  financial information presented may be determined or calculated
differently by other companies.

Segment Results of Operations
We have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and organize by products and services. We
measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income. The use of segment operating income is consistent with the chief operating
decision maker ’s assessment of segment performance.
Segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Segment EBITDA), which is presented below , is a non-GAAP  measure and does not
purport to be an alternat ive to operating income as a measure of operating performance. We believe this measure is useful to management, investors and other
users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expenses
related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our
competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income. Segment EBITDA margin is
calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues.
You can find additional information about our segments in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
 
Wireless
On February 21, 2014, we completed the acquisit ion of Vodafone’ s indirect 45% interest in Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless. Prior to the completion of
the Wireless Transaction, Verizon owned a contro lling 55% interest in Verizon Wireless and Vodafone owned the remaining 45%. As a result of the completion of
the Wireless  Transaction, Verizon acquired 100% ownership of Verizon Wireless. All financial results included in the tables below reflect the consolidated results
of Verizon W ireless.

2016 Compar ed to 2015
Wireless’ total operating revenues decreased by $2.5 billion, or 2.7%, during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of a decline in service revenue partially
offset by increases in equipment and other revenues.
Accounts and Connections
Retail postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers with Verizon Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its branded
services. Accounts inclu de shared data plans, such as our Verizon Plan and More Everything plans, and corporate accounts, as well as legacy single connection
plans and family plans. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices.
Retail connections represent our retail customer device connections. Churn is the rate at which service to connections is terminated. Retail connections under an
account may include those from smartphones and basic phones (collectively , phones) as well as tablets and other devices connected to the Internet, including
retail IoT devices. The U.S. wireless market has achieved a high penetration of smartphones whic h reduces the opportunity for new phone connection growth for
the industry . Retail postp aid connection net addit ions decreased during 2016 primarily due to a decrease in retail postpaid connection gross additions as well as a
higher retail postpaid connection churn rate.
Retail Postpaid Connections per Account
Retail postpaid connections per account is calculated by dividing the total number of retail postpaid connections by the number of retail postpaid accounts as of
the end of the period. Retail postpaid connectio ns per account increased 3.0% as of December  31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 primarily due to
increases in Internet devices, which represented 18.3% of our retail postpaid connection base as of December 31, 2016, compared to 16.8% as of December 31,
2015.
Service Revenue
Service revenue, which does not include recurrin g device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device payment program, decreased by $3.8 billion, or
5.4%, during 2016 comp ared to 2015 primarily driven by lower retail postpaid service revenue. Retail postpaid service revenue was negatively impacted as a
result of customer migra tion to plans with unsubsidized service pricing, including our new price plans launched during 2016 which feature safety mode and
carryover data. Customer migration to unsubsidized service pricing is driven in part by an increase in the activation of devices purchased under the Verizon
device payment program. During the fourth quarter of 2016, phone activations under the Verizon device payment program were 77% of retail postpaid phones
activated. At December 31, 2016, approximately 67% of our retail postpaid phone connections were on unsubsidized service pricing compared to approximately
42% at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, approximately 46% of our retail postpaid phone connections participated in the Verizon device payment
program compared to approximately 29% at December 31, 2015. The decrease in service revenue was partially of fset by an increase in retail postpaid connections
compared to the prior year. Service revenue plus recurring device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device payment program, which represents the total
value received from our wireless connections, increased 2.0% during 2016.
Retail postpaid ARPA (the average service revenue per account from retail postpaid accounts), which does not include recurring device payment plan billings
related to the V erizon device payment program, was negatively impacted during 2016 as a result of customer migration to plans with unsubsidized service pricing,
including our new price  plans launched during 2016 which feature safety mode and carryover data. Retail postpaid I-ARP A (the averag e service revenue per
account from  retail postpaid accounts plus recurring device payment plan billings), which represents the monthly recurring value received on a per account basis
from our retail postpaid accounts, increased 2.5% during 2016.
Equipment Revenue
Equipment revenue increased $0.6 billion, or 3.5%, during 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of an increase in device sales, primarily smartphones, under the
Verizon device payment program, partially offset by a decline in device sales under the traditional fixed-term service plans, promotional activity and a decline in
overall sales volumes.
Under the Verizon device payment program, we recognize a higher amount of equipment revenue at the time of sale of devices. For the year ended December 31,
2016, phone  activations  under the Verizon device payment program represented approxima tely 70% of retail postpaid phones activated compared to
approximately 54% during 2015.
Other Revenue
Other revenu e includes non-service  revenues such as regulatory fees, cost recovery surchar ges, revenues associated with our device protection package, sublease
rentals and financing revenue. Other revenue increased $0.7 billion, or 16.8%, during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to financing revenues from our
device payment program, cost recovery surchar ges and a volume-driven increase in revenues related to our device protection package.
2015 Compar ed to 2014
Wireless’ total operating revenues increased by $4.0 billion, or 4.6%, during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of growth in equipment revenue.
Accounts and Connections
Retail postpaid connection net additions decreas ed during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in retail postpaid connection gross additions,
partially offset by lower retail postpaid connectio n churn rate. The decrease in retail postpaid connection gross additions during 2015 was driven by a decline in
gross additions of smartphones, tablets and other Internet devices.
Retail Postpaid Connections per Account
Retail postpa id connecti ons per account increase d as of December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014. The increase in retail postpaid connections per
account is primarily due to increases in Internet devices, which represented 16.8% of our retail postpaid connection base as of December 31, 2015, compared to
14.1% as of December 31, 2014.
Service Revenue
Service revenue, which does not include recurrin g device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device payment program, decreased by $2.2 billion, or
3.1%, during 2015 comp ared to 2014 primarily driven by lower retail postpaid service revenue. Retail postpaid service revenue was negatively impacted as a
result of an increase in the activation of devices purchased under the Verizon device payment program on plans with unsubsidized service pricing. During the
fourth quarter of 2015, phone activations under the Verizon device payment program represente d approximately 67% of retail postpaid phones activated. The
increase in these activatio ns resulted in a relative shift of revenue from service revenue to equipme nt revenue and caused a change in the timing of the recognition
of revenue. At December  31, 2015, approximately 29% of our retail postpaid phone connections participated in the Verizon device payment program compared to
approximately 8% at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, approximately 42% of our retail postpaid phone connections were on unsubsidized service
pricing. The decrease in service revenue was partially offset by the impact of an increase in retail postpaid connections as well as the continued increase in
penetration of smartphones and tablets through our shared data plans. Service revenue plus recurr ing device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device
payment program increased 2.0% during 2015.
Retail postpa id ARPA, which does not include recurring device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device payment program, was negatively impacted
during 2015  as a result of the increase in the activation of devices purchased under the Verizon device payment program on plans with unsubsidized service
pricing. Partially offsetti ng this impact during 2015 was an increase in our retail postpaid connec tions per account, as discussed above. Retail postpaid I-ARP A,
which represents the monthly recurring value received on a per account basis from our retail postpaid accounts, increased 0.9% during 2015.
Equipment Revenue
Equipment revenue increased by $6.0 billion, or 54.4%, during 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of an increase in device sales, primarily smartphones, under the
Verizon device payment program, partially offset by a decline in device sales under traditional fixed-term service plans. For the year ended December 31, 2015,
phone activations under the Verizon device paym ent program represented approximately 54% of retail postpaid phones activated compared to approximately 18%
during 2014. The increas e in these activations resulted in a relative shift of revenue from service revenue to equipment revenue and caused a change in the timing
of the recognition of revenue. This shift in revenue was the result of recognizing a higher amoun t of equipment revenue at the time of sale of devices under the
device payment program.
Other Revenue
Other revenue increased $0.3 billion, or 7.5%, during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a volume-driven increase in revenues related to our device
protection package.

Cost of Services
Cost of services increase d $0.2 billion, or 2.4%, during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher rent expense as a result of an increase in macro and small
cell sites supporting netw ork capacity expansion and densification, as well as a volume-driven increase in costs related to the device protection package offered to
our customers. Partially of fsetting these increases were decreases in network connection costs and cost of roaming.

cell sites as well as higher wireless network costs from an increase in fiber facilities suppor ting network capacity expansion and densification, including
deployment of small cell technology , to meet growing customer demand for 4G LTE data service s. Also contributing to the increase in Cost of services during
2015 was a volume-driven increase in costs related to the device protection package of fered to our customers.
Cost of Equipment
Cost of equipment decreased $0.9 billion, or 3.8% , during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of a 4.6% decline in the number of smartphone units sold,
partially of fset by an increase in the average cost per unit for smartphones.
Cost of equip ment increased $1.5 billion, or 6.9%, during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of an increase in the average cost per unit, driven by a shift
to higher priced units in the mix of devices sold, partially of fset by a decline in the number of units sold.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $1.9 billion, or 8.6%, during 2016 comp ared to 2015 primarily due to a $1.2 billion decline in sales
commission expense as well as declines in employee related costs, non-income  taxes, bad debt expense and advertising. The decline in sales commission expense
was driven by an overall decline in activations as well as an increase in the proportion of activa tions under the Verizon device payment program, which has a
lower commission per unit than activations under traditional fixed-term service plans. The decline in employee related costs was a result of reduced headcount.
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $1.8 billion, or 7.6%, during 2015 comp ared to 2014 primarily due to a $2.8 billion decline in sales
commission expense. The decline in sales commission expense was driven by an increase in activations under the Verizon device payment program, which has a
lower comm ission per unit than activations under  traditional fixed-term service plans, partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense. The increase in bad debt
expense was primarily driven by a volume increa se in our device payment plan receivables, as the credit quality of our customers remained consistent throughout
the periods presented.
Depr eciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense increased during 2016 and 2015, respectively , primarily driven by an increase in net depreciable assets.

 As of end of period
Wireline’ s revenues decreased $0.7 billion, or 2.3%, during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of declines in Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale.
Wireline’ s revenues were also partially impacted  by a reduction in Fios marketing activities during the union work stoppage that commenced on April 13, 2016
and ended on June 1, 2016. Fios revenues were $11.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $10.7 billion during the similar period in
2015.
Mass Markets
Mass Marke ts operations provide broadband Internet and video services (including high-speed Internet, Fios Internet and Fios video services) and local exchange
(basic service and end-user  access) and long distance (including regional toll) voice services to residential and small business subscribers.
2016 Compar ed to 2015
Mass Markets revenues decreased 0.3%, during 2016 compared to 2015 as the continued decline of local exchange revenues was partially offset by increases in
Fios revenues due to subscriber growth for Fios services (Internet, video and voice).(1)
(1)
The decline of local exchange revenues was primarily due to a 7.5% decline in Consumer retail voice connections resulting primarily from competition and
technology substitution with wireless and compet ing voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and cable  telephony services. Total voice connections include traditional
switched access lines in service as well as Fios digital voice connections. There was also an 8.0% decline in Small business retail voice connections, reflecting
competition and a shift to both IP and high-speed circuits, primarily in areas outside of our Fios footprint.
During 2016, we grew our subscriber base by 0.2 million Fios Internet subscribers and 0.1 million Fios video subscribers, while also improving penetration rates
within our Fios service areas for Fios Internet. As of December 31, 2016, we achieved a penetratio n rate of 40.4% for Fios Internet compared to a penetration rate
of 40.2% for Fios Internet as of December 31, 2015. Our Fios connection growth for 2016 was impacted by a reduction in Fios marketing activities during the
union work stoppage that commenced on April 13, 2016 and ended on June 1, 2016. Consumer Fios revenues increased $0.4 billion, or 4.3%. Fios represented
approximately 82% of Consumer retail revenue during 2016 compared to approximately 79% during 2015.
2015 Compar ed to 2014
Mass Markets revenues increased $0.4 billion, or 3.2%, during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the expansion of Fios services (voice, Internet and video),
including our Fios Quantum of ferings, as well as changes in our pricing strategies, partially of fset by the continued decline of local exchange revenues.
During 2015, we grew our subscriber base by 0.4 million Fios Internet subscribers and by 0.2 million Fios video subscribers, while also improving the penetration
rate within our Fios service areas for Fios Internet. As of December 31, 2015, we achieved a penetration rate of 40.2% for Fios Internet compared to a penetration
rate of 39.5%  for Fios Internet as of December 31, 2014. During 2015, Consumer Fios revenue increased $0.9 billion, or 9.5%. Fios represented approximately
79% of Consumer retail revenue during 2015 compared to approximately 75% during 2014.
The decline of local exchange revenues was primarily due to a 6.2% decline in Consumer retail voice connections resulting primarily from competition and
technology substitution with wireless, competing  VoIP and cable telephony services. Total voice connections include traditional switched access lines in service
as well as Fios digital voice connections. There was also a 7.1% decline in Small business retail voice connections, reflecting competition and a shift to both IP
and high-speed circuits, primarily in areas outside of our Fios footprint.
Global Enterprise
Global Enterprise offers advanced information and communication technology services and other traditional communications services to medium and large
business customers, multinational corporations and state and federal government customers.
2016 Compar ed to 2015
Global Enter prise revenu es decreased $0.4 billion, or 3.6%, during 2016 compared to 2015 due to declines in traditional data and advanced networking solutions,
cloud and IT services and voice communications services. Also contributing to the decrease was the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Our traditional
data networking services, which consist of traditi onal circuit-based services such as frame relay , private line and legacy data networking services, our advanced
networking solutions, which include Private IP, Public Internet, Ethernet and optical network services, and our cloud and IT services declined as a result of
competitive price pressures.
2015 Compar ed to 2014
Global Enterprise revenues decreased $0.8 billion, or 6.0%, during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decline in core voice services and data networking
revenues, which consist of traditional circuit-based services such as frame relay , private line and legacy voice and data services. These core services declined as a
result of secular declines. Also contributing to the decrease were lower networking solutions reven ues, a decline in customer premise equipment revenues and the
negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Networking solutions, which include Private IP, Public Internet, Ethernet and optical network services, declined as a
result of competitive price compression.
Global Wholesale
Global Wholesale provides communications services, including data, voice and local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local, long distance and other
carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers.
2016 Compar ed to 2015
Global Wholesale revenues decreased $0.3 billion, or 4.9%, during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to declines in data revenues and traditional voice
revenues driven by the effect of technology substitution as well as continuing contraction of market rates due to competition. As a result of technology
substitution, the number of core data circuits at December 31, 2016 decreased 16.3% compared to December 31, 2015. The decline in traditional voice revenue is
driven by a 5.8% decline in domestic wholesale connections at December 31, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015.
2015 Compar ed to 2014
Global Wholesale revenues decreased $0.2 billion, or 3.4%, during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to declines in traditional voice revenues and data
revenues driven by the effect of technology substitution as well as continuing contraction of market rates due to competition. The decline in traditional voice
revenue was also due to a decrease in minutes of use. We experienced a 7.3% decline in domestic wholesale connections between December 31, 2015 and
December 31, 2014. As a result of technology substitution, the number of core data circuits at December 31, 2015 decreased 14.7% compared to December 31,
2014.

Cost of Services
Cost of services decreas ed $0.2 billion, or 1.0%, during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a decline in net pension and postretirement benefit cost, a
$0.3 billion decline in access costs driven by declines in overall wholesale long distance volumes and rates and employee costs as a result of reduced headcount.
These decreases were partially offset by $0.4 billion of incremental costs incurred as a result of the union work stoppage that commenced on April 13, 2016 and
ended on June 1, 2016 as well as a $0.2 billion increase in content costs associated with continued programming license fee increases and continued Fios
subscriber growth.
Cost of services decreased during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a $0.4 billion decline in employee costs as a result of reduced headcount as well as a
$0.3 billion decline in access costs driven by declines in overall wholesale long distance volumes. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in content
costs of $0.4 billion associated with continued Fios subscriber growth and programming license fee increases.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, gene ral and administrative expense decreased $0.7 billion, or 9.2%, during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to declines in employee costs as a result
of reduced headcount, a decline in net pension and postretirement benefit costs and decreases in non-income  taxes.
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to declines in employee costs as a result of reduced headcount
and decreased administrative expenses, partially of fset by an increase in non-income  taxes.
Depr eciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased during 2016 and 2015 compared to the prior year periods primarily due to decreases in net depreciable assets.

Severance, Pension and Benefit Charges (Cr edits)
During 2016, we recorded net pre-tax  severance, pension and benefit charges of $2.9 billion in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains
and losses in the period in which they occur . The pension and benefit remeasurement charges of $2.5 billion were primarily driven by a decrease in our discount
rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension and other postr etirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 4.6% at
December 31, 2015 to a weighted-average of 4.2% at December 31, 2016 ($2.1 billion), updated health care trend cost assumptions ($0.9 billion), the difference
between our estimated return on assets of 7.0% and our actual return on assets of 6.0% ($0.2 billion) and other assumption adjustments ($0.3 billion). These
charges were  partially offset by a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2016)  issued by the Society of
Actuaries ($0.5 billion) and lower negotiated prescription drug pricing ($0.5 billion). As part of these charges, we also recorded severance costs of $0.4 billion
under our existing separation plans.
The net pre-tax  severance, pension and benefit charges during 2016 were comprised of a net pre-tax  pension remeasurement charge of $0.2 billion measured as of
March 31, 2016 related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum  distributions in one of our defined benefit pension plans, a net pre-tax  pension and
benefit remeasurement charge of $0.8 billion measured as of April 1, 2016 related to curtailments in three of our defined benefit pension and one of our other
postretirement plans, a net pre-tax  pension and benefit remeasurement charge of $2.7 billion measured as of May 31, 2016 in two defined benefit pension plans
and three other postretirement benefit plans as a result of our accounting for the contractual healthcare caps and bargained for changes, a net pre-tax  pension
remeasurement charge of $0.1 billion measured as of May 31, 2016 related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum  distribution s in three of our
defined bene fit pension plans, a net pre-tax  pension remeasurement charge of $0.6 billion measured as of August 31, 2016 related to settlements for employees
who received lump-sum  distribution s in five of our defined benefit pension plans, and a net pre-tax  pension and benefit credit of $1.9 billion as a result of our
fourth quarter remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement assets and liabilities based on updated actuarial assumptions.
During 2015, we recorde d net pre-tax  severa nce, pension and benefit credits of approximately $2.3 billion primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in
accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which  they occur . The credits were primarily driven by an increase in
our discount rate assump tion used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 4.2% at December 31, 2014 to a weighted-average of 4.6%
at December 31, 2015 ($2.5 billion), the execution of a new prescription drug contract during 2015 ($1.0 billion) and a change in mortality assumptions primarily
driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2015)  issued by the Society of Actuaries ($0.9 billion), partially offset by the difference between our estimated
return on assets of 7.25% at December 31, 2014 and our actual return on assets of 0.7% at Decem ber 31, 2015 ($1.2 billion), severance costs recorded under our
existing separation plans ($0.6 billion) and other assumption adjustments ($0.3 billion).
During 2014, we recorde d net pre-tax  severa nce, pension and benefit charges of approx imately $7.5 billion primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in
accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which  they occur . The charges were primarily driven by a decrease in
our discount rate assump tion used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 5.0% at December 31, 2013 to a weighted-average of 4.2%
at December  31, 2014 ($5.2 billion), a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (RP-2014  and MP-2014)  issued by
the Society of Actuaries in October 2014 ($1.8 billion) and revisions to the retirement assumptio ns for participants and other assumption adjustments, partially
offset by the difference between our estimated return on assets of 7.25% and our actual return on assets of 10.5% ($0.6 billion). As part of this charge, we
recorded severance costs of $0.5 billion under our existing separation plans.
The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP  measure presented in the Consolidated Net Income, Operating Income and EBITDA discussion (see
“Consolidated Results of Operations”) excludes the severance, pension and benefit char ges (credits) presented above.
 
Early Debt Redemption and Other Costs
During 2016, we recorded net debt redemption costs of $1.8 billion in connection with the early redemption of $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of Verizon
Communications notes called and redeemed in whole, as well as the early redemption pursuant to three concurrent, but separate, tender offers of the following:
$3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Verizo n Communications notes included in the Group 1 Any and All Offer; $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of
debentures of our operating telephone company subsidiaries included in the Group 2 Any and All Of fer;
$3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of Verizon Communications notes, $0.2 billion aggre gate principal amount of Alltel Corporation debentures and
$0.3 billion aggregate principal amount of GTE Corporation debentures included in the Group 3 Offer. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional details related to our early debt redemptions.
During 2014, we recorded net debt redemption costs of $1.4 billion in connection with the early redemption of $4.5 billion aggregate principal amount of Verizon
Communications notes, $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of Cellco Partnership and Verizon Wireless Capital LLC notes and $0.1 billion aggregate
principal amount of Alltel Corporation debentures as well as the purchase of the following pursuant to a tender offer: $3.2 billion aggregate principal amount of
Verizon Com munications notes, $0.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Cellco Partnership and Verizon Wireless Capital LLC notes, $0.3 billion aggregate
principal amount of GTE  Corporation debentures and $0.2 billion aggregate principal amount of Alltel Corporation debentures. We also recorded $0.3 billion of
other costs.
We recognize early debt redemption costs in Other income and (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income.
 
Gain on Access Line Sale
During the second quarte r of 2016, we completed the Access Line Sale. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax  gain of approximately $1.0 billion in
Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. The pre-tax  gain included a
$0.5 billion pension and postretirement benefit curtailment gain due to the elimination of the accrual of pension and other postretirement benefits for some or all
future services of a significant number of employees covered in three of our defined benefit pension plans and one of our other postretirement benefit plans.
The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP  measure presented in the Consolidated Net Income, Operating Income and EBITDA discussion (see
“Consolidated Results of Operations”) excludes the gain on the access line sale described above.
 
Gain on Spectrum License T ransactions
During the first quarter of 2016, we completed a license exchange transaction with affiliates of AT&T  Inc. (AT&T) to exchange certain Advanced Wireless
Services (A WS) and Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum licenses. As a result of this non-cash  exchange, we received $0.4 billion of A WS and PCS
spectrum licenses at fair value and we recorded a pre-tax  gain of approximately $0.1 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consoli dated
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed a license exchange transaction with an affiliate of T-Mobile  USA Inc. (T-Mobile  USA) to exchange certain A WS
and PCS licenses. As a result of this non-cash  exchange, we received $0.4 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and we recorded a pre-tax  gain
of approximately $0.3 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2015.
During the second quarter of 2014, we completed license exchange transactions with T-Mobile  USA to exchange certain AWS and PCS license s. The exchange
included a number of swaps that we expect will result in more efficient use of the AWS and PCS bands. As a result of these exchanges, we received $0.9 billion
of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and we recorded an immaterial gain.
During the second quarte r of 2014, we completed transactions pursuant to two additional agreemen ts with T-Mobile  USA with respect to our remaining 700 MHz
A block spectrum licenses. Under one agreement, we sold certain of these licenses to T-Mobile  USA in exchange for cash consideration of approximately
$2.4 billion, and under the second agreement we exchanged the remainder of our 700 MHz A block spectrum licenses as well as AWS and PCS spectrum licenses
for AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. As a result, we received $1.6 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and we recorded a pre-tax  gain of
approximately $0.7 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2014.
The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA  non-GAAP  measure presented in the Consolidated Net Income, Operating Income and EBITDA discussion (see
“Consolidated Results of Operations”) excludes the gains on the spectrum license transactions described above.
 
Wireless T ransaction Costs
As a result of the third -party indebtedness incurred to finance the Wireless Transaction, we incurred interest expense of $0.4 billion during 2014 (see

As a result of the sale of the Omnitel Interest on February 21, 2014, which was part of the consideration for the Wireless Transaction, we recorded a gain of
$1.9 billion in Equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated businesses on our consolidated statement of income during 2014.
Impact of Divested Operations
On April 1, 2016, we completed the Access Line Sale to Frontier .
On July 1, 2014, we sold a non-strategic  Wireline business that provides communications solutions to a variety of government agencies.
The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA  non-GAAP  measure presented in the Consolidated Net Income, Operating Income and EBITDA discussion (see
“Consolidated Results of Operations”) excludes the historical financial results of the divested operations described above.
 
Operating Envir onment and T rends
The industrie s that we operate in are highly competitive, which we expect to continue particularl y as traditional, non-traditional  and emer ging service providers
seek increased market share. We believe that our high-quality customer base and superior networks differentiate us from our competitors and give us the ability to
plan and manage through changing economic and competitive conditions. We remain focused on executing on the fundamentals of the business: maintaining a
high-quality customer base, delivering strong financial and operating results and generating strong free cash flows. We will continue to invest for growth, which
we believe is the key to creating value for our shareowners. We are investing in innovative technology , such as 5G and high-speed fiber, as well as the platforms
that will position us to capture incremental profitable growth in new areas, like mobile video and IoT, to position ourselves at the center of growth trends of the
future.
The U.S. wireless marke t has achieved a high penetration of smartphones which reduces the opportunity for new phone connection growth for the industry . We
expect future  revenue growth in the industry to be driven by monetization of usage through new ecosystems, and penetration increases in other connected devices
including tablets and IoT devices. Current and potential competitors in the U.S. wireless market include other national wireless service providers, various regional
wireless service providers, wireless resellers as well as other communications and technology companies providing wireless products and services.
Service and equipment pricing continue to play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. We compete in this area by offering our customers
services and devices that we believe they will regard as the best available value for the price. As the demand for wireless data services continues to grow , we and
other wireles s service providers are offering service plans at competitive prices that include a specific amount of data access in varying megabyte or gigabyte
sizes or, in some cases, unlimited data usage subject to certain restrictions. These allowances will vary from time to time as part of promotional offers or in
response to market circumstances. We and many other wireless service providers allow customers  to carry over unused data allowances to the next billing period
or provide access to specific data content free of data charges to the customer . We expect future service growth opportunities to arise following the migration of
customers to unsubsidize d pricing and will be dependent on expanding the penetration of our services and increasing the number of ways that our customers can
connect with our network and services.
Many wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment optio ns that distinguish service pricing from equipment pricing and
blur the traditional boundary between prepaid and postpaid plans. These payment options include device payment plans, which provide customers with the ability
to pay for their device over a period of time, and device leasing arrangements. Historically , wireless service providers offered customers wireless plans whereby ,
in exchange for the customer entering into a fixed-term service agreement, the wireless service providers significantly , and in some cases fully, subsidized the
customer ’s device purchase. Wireless providers  recovered those subsidies through higher service fees as compared to those paid by customers on device
installment plans. We and many other wireless providers have limited or discontinued this form of device subsidy . As a result, we have experienced significant
growth in the percentag e of activations on device payment plans and the number of customers  on plans with unsubsidized service pricing. The increase in
activations on device payment plans results in a relative shift of revenue from service revenue to equipment revenue and causes a change in the timing of the
recognition of revenue. This shift in revenue is the result of recognizing a higher amount of equipment revenue at the time of sale of devices under the device
payment program, while recognizing a lower amount of monthly service revenue with unsubsidized service pricing.
Current and potential competitors to our Wireline businesses include cable companies, wireless service providers, other domestic and foreign telecommunications
providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers and other companies that of fer network services and managed enterprise solutions.
In addition, companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our Wireline busin esses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and
integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale markets. We compete with
these full or near-full service providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have strong market
presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may af fect our future revenue growth.
Despite this challenging environment, we expect that we will be able to grow key aspects of our Wireline segment by providing network reliability , offering
product bundles that include broadband Interne t access, digital television and local and long distance voice services, offering more robust IP products and
services, and accelerating our IoT strategies. We will also continue to focus on cost efficiencies to attempt to offset adverse impacts from unfavorable economic
conditions and competitive pressures.
2017 Connection T rends
In our Wireless segment, we expect to continue to attract and maintain the loyalty of high-qual ity retail postpaid customers, capitalizing on demand for data
services and bringing our customers new ways  of using wireless services in their daily lives. We expect that future connection growth will be driven by
smartphones, tablets and other connected devices. W e believe these devices will attract and retain higher value retail postpaid
connections, contribute to continued increases in the penetration of data services and help us remain competitive with other wireless carriers. We expect to
manage churn by providing a consistent, reliable experience on our wireless network and focusing on improving the customer experience through simplified
pricing and better execution in our distribution channels.
In our Wireline segment , we have experienced continuing access line losses as customers have disconnected both primary and secondary lines and switched to
alternative technologies such as wireless, V oIP and cable for voice and data services. W e expect to continue to experience access line losses as customers continue
to switch to alternate technologies. As we seek to increase our penetration rates within our Fios service areas and expand our existing business through initiatives
such as One Fiber , we expect to continue to grow our Fios Internet and video connections.
2017 Operating Revenue T rends
In our Wireless segment, we expect to continue to experience declines in service revenue as a result of our customer base migration to unsubsidized service
pricing, the introduction  of new pricing structures in 2016 and early 2017 and the use of prom otions. Equipment revenues are largely dependent on wireless
device sales volumes, the mix of devices, promo tions and upgrade cycles, which are subject to device lifecycles, iconic device launches and competition within
the wireless industry .
We expect growth in our Fios broadband and video subscriber base to positively impact our Consumer retail revenue. We also expect a continuing decline in
Consumer retail revenue related to retail voice and legacy broadband connection losses. We expec t a continued decline in revenues for our legacy wholesale and
enterprise markets. However , we expect the acquisition of XO Holdings’ wireline business to mitigate these declines. In Global Enterprise, we also expect
additional revenues from application services, such as our cloud, security and other solutions-base d services, and continued customer migration of their services
to Private IP and other strategic networking services to partially mitigate these pressures.
We expect initiatives to develop platforms, content and applications in the mobile video and IoT space will have a long-term positive impact on revenues, drive
usage on our network and monetize our investments.
2017 Operating Cost and Expense T rends
We expect our consolidated operating income margin and adjusted EBITDA margin to remain strong as we continue to undertake initiatives to reduce our overall
cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiency in our operations throughout the business in 2017 and beyond. Expenses related to new products
and services, such as mobile video, and expenses related to newly acquired businesses will apply of fsetting pressure to our mar gins.
Cash Flow fr om Operations
We create value for our shareowners by investing the cash flows generated by our business in opportunities and transactions that support continued profitable
growth, thereby increasi ng customer satisfaction and usage of our products and services. In addition, we have used our cash flows to maintain and grow our
dividend payout to shareowners. Verizon’ s Board of Directors increased the Company’ s quarterly dividend by 2.2% during 2016, making this the tenth
consecutive year in which we have raised our dividend.
During 2016, we changed the method in which we monetize device payment plan receivables from sales of device payment plan receivables to asset-backed
securitizations. While proceeds from sales of device payment plan receivables were reflected in our cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated
statements of cash flows, proceeds from asset-ba cked securitizations are reflected in cash flows from financing activities. This change will result in lower cash
flow from operations, but will not reduce the cash we have available to run the business.
Our goal is to use our cash to create long-term value for our shareholders. We will continue to look for investment opportunities that will help us to grow the
business, acquire spectrum licenses (see “Cash Flows from Investing Activities”), pay dividends to our shareholders and, when appropriate, buy back shares of
our outstanding common stock (see “Cash Flows from Financing Activities”).
Capital Expenditur es
Our 2017 capital program  includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including adding capacity and density to our 4G LTE network in order to stay
ahead of our customers’ increasing data demands and pre-position  our network for 5G, building out fiber assets for wireless backhaul and to deliver Fios services
to customer s as part of our One Fiber initiative, expanding our core networks, supporting our copper -based legacy voice networks and pursuing other
opportunities to drive operating efficiencies. The level and the timing of the Company’ s capital expenditures within these broad categories can vary significantly
as a result of a variety of factors outside of our control, such as material weather events. Capital expenditures were $17.1 billion in 2016 and $17.8 billion in
2015. We believe that we have significant discre tion over the amount and timing of our capital expenditures on a Company-wide basis as we are not subject to
any agreement that would require significant capital expenditures on a designated schedule or upon the occurrence of designated events.

We use the net cash generated from our operations to fund network expansion and modernization, service and repay external financing, pay dividends, invest in
new businesses and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent
necessary , from external financing arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements. We expect that our capital spending
requirements will continue to be financed primari ly through internally generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or
development activities or to maintain an appro priate capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility . Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily held
domestically and are invested to maintain princip al and liquidity . Accordingly , we do not have significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. See “Market
Risk” for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies.
Our available external financing arrangements include an active commercial paper program, credi t available under credit facilities and other bank lines of credit,
vendor financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities and privately-placed capital market securities. In addition, our available
arrangements to monetize our device payment plan agreement receivables include asset-backed securitizations and sales of selected receivables to relationship
banks.
 
Cash Flows Pr ovided By Operating Activities
Our primary  source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations, primarily from our Wireless segment. Net cash provided by operating activities
during 2016 decreased by $16.2 billion primarily due to a change in the method in which we monetize device payment plan receivables, as discussed below , as
well as a decline in earnings, an increase in income taxes paid primarily as a result of the Access Line Sale, and $2.4 billion of cash proceeds received in 2015 as
a result of our transaction (T ower Monetization T ransaction) with American T ower Corporation (American T ower).
During 2016, we chang ed the method in which we monetize device payment plan receivables  from sales of device payment plan receivables, which were
recorded within cash flows provided by operat ing activities, to asset-backed securitization transactions, which are recorded in cash flows from financing
activities. During 2016,  we received cash proceeds related to sales of wireless device payme nt plan agreement receivables of $2.0 billion and collected
$1.1 billion of deferred purchase price. During 2015, we received $7.2 billion of cash proceeds related to new sales of wireless device payment plan agreement
receivables. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. During 2016, we received proceeds from asset-backed securitization
transactions of $5.0 billion. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements and “Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities” for more information.
Net cash provided by operating activities during 2015 increased by $8.3 billion primarily due to $5.9 billion of cash proceeds, net of remittances, related to the
sale of wireless device payment plan agreement receivables as well as $2.4 billion of cash proceeds received as a result of the T ower Monetization T ransaction.
We complet ed the Tower Monetization Transaction in March 2015, pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate
approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion, of which $2.4 billion related to a portion of the towers for which the
right-of-use  has passed to the tower operator . See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
 
Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities
Capital Expenditur es
Capital expe nditures continue to relate primarily to the use of capital resources to facilitate the introduction of new products and services, enhance responsiveness
to competitive challenges and increase the operating ef ficiency and productivity of our networks.
Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, were as follows:
 
(dollars in millions)   
Years Ended December 31,    2016      2015      2014   
  
Wireless   $    11,240     $    11,725     $      10,515   
Wireline    4,504      5,049      5,750

Total as a percentage of revenue    13.5%      13.5%      13.5%   
Capital expe nditures decreased at Wireless in 2016 primarily due to the timing of investmen ts to increase the capacity of our 4G LTE network. Capital
expenditures increased at Wireless in 2015 in order to increase the capacity of our 4G LTE network. Capital expenditures declined at Wireline in 2016 as a result
of capital expenditures related to the local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas that were sold to Frontier on April 1,
2016 and reduced capital spending during the work stoppage that commenced April 13, 2016 and ended June 1, 2016. Capital expenditures declined at Wireline
in 2015 as a result of decreased legacy spending requirements as well as decreased Fios spending requirements in 2015.
Acquisitions
During 2016 , 2015 and 2014, we invested $0.5 billion, $9.9 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively , in acquisitions of wireless licenses. During 2016, 2015 and
2014, we also invested $3.8 billion, $3.5 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively , in acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired.
In July 2016, we acquired T elogis, a global cloud-based mobile enterprise management business, for $0.9 billion of cash consideration.
In November 2016, we acquired Fleetmatics, a leading global provider of fleet and mobile work force management solutions, for $60.00 per ordinary share in
cash. The aggregate mer ger consideration was approximately $2.5 billion, including cash acquired of $0.1 billion.
On January 29, 2015, the FCC completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum, which it identified as the AWS-3  band. Verizon participated in that auction, and was
the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we made a deposit of
$0.9 billion related to our participation in this auction, which is classified within Other , net investin g activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the
year ended December 31, 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, we submitted an application to the FCC and paid $9.5 billion to the FCC to complete payment
for these licenses. The cash payment of $9.5 billion is classified within Acquisitions of wireless licenses on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year
ended December 31, 2015. On April 8, 2015, the FCC granted us these spectrum licenses.
On May 12, 2015, we entered into the Merger Agreement with AOL pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
common stock of AOL at a price of $50.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. On June 23, 2015, we
completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL  became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing
of these transactions was approximately $3.8 billion, net of cash acquired of $0.5 billion. Holders of approximately 6.6 million shares exercised appraisal rights
under Delaware law . If they had not exercised these rights, V erizon would have paid an additional $330 million for such shares at closing.
During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we acquired various other businesses and investments for cash consideration that was not significant.
See “Acquisitions and Divestitures” for additional information on our acquisitions.
Dispositions
During 2016, we received cash proceeds of $9.9 billion in connection with the completion of the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016.
During 2014 , we received proceeds of $2.4 billio n related to spectrum license transactions and $0.1 billion related to the disposition of a non-strategic  Wireline
business.
See “Acquisitions and Divestitures” for additional information on our dispositions.
Other , net
On May 19, 2015, we consummated a sale-leaseb ack transaction with a financial services firm for the buildings and real estate at our Basking Ridge, New Jersey
location. We received total gross proceeds of $0.7 billion resulting in a deferred gain of $0.4 billion, which will be amortized over the initial leaseback term of
twenty years . The leaseback of the buildings and real estate is accounted for as an operating lease. The proceeds received as a result of this transaction have been
classified within Other , net investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. Also in 2015, we received proceeds of $0.2 billion related to a sale of real
estate.
Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities
We seek to maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, net cash used
in financing activities was $13.3 billion, $15.0 billion and $57.7 billion, respectively .
2016
During 2016, our net cash used in financing activities of $13.3 billion was primarily driven by:
 
 • $19.2 billion used for repayments of long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations; and
 
 • $9.3 billion used for dividend payments.
These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $18.0 billion, which included $5.0 billion of proceeds from our asset-backed
debt transactions.
Proceeds fr om and Repayments of Long-T erm Borr owings
At Decembe r 31, 2016, our total debt decreased to $108.1 billion as compared to $109.7 billion at December 31, 2015. Our effective interest rate was 4.8% and
4.9% during the years ended December 31, 2016  and 2015, respectively . The substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consists of fixed rate indebtedness,
therefore, changes in interest rates do not have a material effect on our interest payments. See also “Market Risk” and Note 6 to the consolidated financial
statements for additional details.
At December 31, 2016, approximately $11.6 billion or 10.7% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt,
primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on a majority of our foreign denominated debt in order to fix our future
interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See “Market Risk” for additional
information.
Verizon may continue to acquire debt securities issued by Verizon and its affiliates in the future through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions,
tender of fers, exchange of fers, or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as V erizon may from time to time determine for cash or other consideration.
Other , net
Other , net financing activities during 2016, includes net early debt redemption costs of $1.8 billion. See “Other Items” for additional information related to the
early debt redemption costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.
Dividends
The Verizon  Board of Directors assesses the level of our dividend payments on a periodic basis taking into account such factors as long-term growth
opportunities, internal cash requirements and the expectations of our shareholders. During the third quarter of 2016, the Board increased our quarterly dividend
payment 2.2% to $0.5775 from $0.565 per share in the prior period. This is the tenth consecutive year that Verizon’ s Board of Directors has approved a quarterly
dividend increase.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2016, we paid $9.3 billion in dividends.
2015
During 2015, our net cash used in financing activities of $15.0 billion was primarily driven by:
 
 • $9.3 billion used for repayments of long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations, including the repayment of $6.5 billion of borrowings under a
term loan agreement;
 
 • $8.5 billion used for dividend payments; and
 
 • $5.0 billion payment for our accelerated share repurchase agreement.
These uses of cash were  partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $6.7 billion,  which included $6.5 billion of borrowings under a term loan
agreement which was used for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of spectrum licenses, as well as $2.7 billion of cash proceeds received related
to the T ower Monetization T ransaction attributable to the portion of the towers that we continue to occupy and use for network operations.
Proceeds fr om and Repayments of Long-T erm Borr owings
At Decembe r 31, 2015, our total debt decreased to $109.7 billion as compared to $112.8 billion at December 31, 2014. The substantial majority of our total debt
portfolio consists of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in interest rates do not have a material effect on our interest payments. See Note 6 to the
consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our debt activity .
At December 31, 2015, approximately $8.2 billion or 7.5% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt,
primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps in order  to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars
and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See “Market Risk” for additional information.
Other , net
Other , net financing activities during 2015 included $2.7 billion of cash proceeds received relate d to the Tower Monetization Transaction, which relates to the
portion of the towers that we continue to occupy and use for network operations partially of fset by the settlement of derivatives upon maturity for $0.4 billion.
Dividends
During the third quarter of 2015, the Board increased our quarterly dividend payment 2.7% to $0.565 per share from $0.550 per share in the same prior period.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2015, we paid $8.5 billion in dividends.
2014
During 2014, our net cash used in financing activities of $57.7 billion was primarily driven by:
 
 • $58.9 billion used to partially fund the W ireless T ransaction (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements);
 
 • $17.7 billion used for repayments of long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations; and
 
 • $7.8 billion used for dividend payments.
These uses of cash were partially of fset by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $31.0 billion.
Proceeds fr om and Repayments of Long-T erm Borr owings
At December 31, 2014, our total debt increased to $112.8 billion as compared to $93.1 billion at December 31, 2013 primarily as a result of additional debt issued
to finance the Wireless Transaction. Since the substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consists of fixed rate indebtedness, changes in interest rates do not
have a material effect on our interest payments. Throughout 2014, we accessed the capital markets to optimize the maturity schedule of our debt portfolio and
take advantage of lower interest rates, thereby reducing our effective interest rate to 4.9% from 5.2% in 2013. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements
for additional details regarding our debt activity .
At December 31, 2014, approximately $9.6 billion or 8.5% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt,
primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps in order  to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars
and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See “Market Risk” for additional information.
See “Other Items” for additional information related to the early debt redemption costs incurred in 2014.
Dividends
During the third quarter of 2014, the Board increased our quarterly dividend payment 3.8% to $0.550 per share from $0.530 per share in the same period of 2013.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2014, we paid $7.8 billion in dividends.
Asset-Backed Debt
As of Decem ber 31, 2016, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $5.0 billion. Our asset- backed debt includes notes (the Asset-Backed Notes) issued to
third-party investors (Investors) and loans (ABS Financing Facility) received from banks and their conduit facilities (collectively , the Banks). Our consolidated
asset-backed securitizatio n bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, an ABS Entity or collectively , the ABS Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the
transaction documentation in connection with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-backed debt, we transfer device payment plan
agreement receivables from Cellco Partnership and certain other affiliates of Verizon (collective ly, the Originators) to one of the ABS Entities, which in turn
transfer such receivables to another ABS Entity that issues the debt. Verizon entities retain the equity interests in the ABS Entities, which represent the rights to
all funds not needed to make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other related payments and expenses.
Our asset-ba cked debt is secured by the transferred device payment plan agreement receivables and future collections on such receivables. The device payment
plan agreement receivables transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of asset-
backed debt and expenses related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of device payment plan agreement receivables, and other
obligations arising from our asset-backed debt transactions, and will not be available to pay other obligations or claims of Verizon’ s creditors until the associated
asset-backed debt and other obligations are satisfied. The Investors or Banks, as
applicable, which hold our asset-backed debt have legal recourse to the assets securing the debt, but do not have any recourse to Verizon with respect to the
payment of principal and interest on the debt. Under a parent support agreement, Verizon has agreed to guarantee certain of the payment obligations of Cellco
Partnership and the Originators to the ABS Entities.
Cash collections on the device payment plan agreement receivables are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the
segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
Proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions , deposits to the segregated accounts and payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of device
payment plan agreement receivables, are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Repayments of our asset-
backed debt and related interest payments made  from the segregated accounts are non-cash  activities and therefore are not reflected within Cash flows from
financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The asset-backed debt issued and the assets securing this debt are included on our consolidated
balance sheets.
Although the ABS Financing Facility is fully drawn as of December 31, 2016, we have the right  to prepay all or a portion thereof at any time. If we choose to
prepay , the amount prepaid shall be available for further drawdowns until September 2018, except in certain circumstances.
Credit Facilities
On September 23, 2016, we amended our $8.0 billion credit facility to increase the availability to $9.0 billion and extend the maturity to September 23, 2020. As
of December 31, 2016, the unused borrowing capacity under our $9.0 billion credit facility was approximately $8.9 billion. The credit facility does not require us
to comply with financial  covenants or maintain specified credit ratings, and it permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change.
We use the credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit and for general corporate purposes.
In March 2016, we enter ed into an equipment credit facility insured by Eksportkreditnamnden Stockholm, Sweden (EKN), the Swedish export credit agency , with
the ability to borrow up to $1 billion to finance locally-sourced network equipment-related purchases. The facility has borrowings available through June 2017,
contingent upon the amount of equipment-related  purchases made by Verizon. As of December 31, 2016 we had drawn $0.5 billion on the facility and the unused
borrowing capacity was $0.5 billion.
Common Stock
Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans, including 3.5 million,
22.6 million and 18.2 million common shares issued from Treasury stock during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively , which had aggregate values of an immaterial
amount, $0.9 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively .
In February 2015, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized Verizon to enter into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement to repurchase $5.0 billion of
the Compan y’s common stock. On February 10, 2015, in exchange for an upfront payment totaling $5.0 billion, Verizon received an initial delivery of
86.2 million shares having a value of approximately $4.25 billion. On June 5, 2015, Verizon received an additional 15.4 million shares as final settlement of the
transaction under the ASR agreement. In total, 101.6 million shares were delivered under the ASR at an average repurchase price of $49.21.
On March 7, 2014, the Verizon Board of Directors approved a share buyback program, which authorizes the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of Verizon
common stock terminati ng no later than the close of business on February 28, 2017. The program permits Verizon to repurchase shares over time, with the
amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. The Board also determined that no additional shares were to be
purchased under the prior program. There were no repurchases of common stock during 2016 and 2014. During 2015, we repurchased $0.1 billion of our common
stock as part of our share buyback program.
As a result of the W ireless Transaction, in February 2014, V erizon issued approximately 1.27 billion shares of common stock.
Credit Ratings
Verizon’ s credit ratings did not change in 2016, 2015 or 2014.
Securities ratings assigned by rating organization s are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is
subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating or ganization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Covenants
Our credit agreements contain covenants that are typical for large, investment grade companies. These covenants include requirements to pay interest and
principal in a timely fashion, pay taxes, maintain insurance with responsible and reputable insurance companies, preserve our corporate
existence, keep appropriate books and records of financial transactions, maintain our properties, provide financial and other reports to our lenders, limit pledging
and dispositi on of assets and mergers and consolidations, and other similar covenants. Additionally , our term loan credit agreements require us to maintain a
leverage ratio (as such term is defined in those agreements) not in excess of 3.50:1.00 until our credit ratings are equal to or higher than A3 and A-.
We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our financial and restrictive covenants.
2017 T erm Loan Agr eement
During January 2017, we entered into a term loan credit agreement with a syndicate of major financial institutions, pursuant to which we can borrow up to
$5.5 billion for (i) the acquisition of Yahoo and (ii) general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the term loan credit agreement mature 18 months following the
funding date, with a partial mandatory prepayment required within six months following the funding date. The term loan agreement contains certain negative
covenants, including a negative pledge covenant,  a merger or similar transaction covenant and an accounting changes covenant, affirmative covenants and events
of default that are customary for companies main taining an investment grade credit rating. In addition, the term loan credit agreement requires us to maintain a
leverage ratio (as defined  in the term loan credit agreement) not in excess of 3.50:1.00, until our credit ratings are equal to or higher than A3 and A- at Moody’ s
Investor Service and S&P Global Ratings, respectively . To date, we have not drawn on this term loan.
 
Change In Cash and Cash Equivalents
Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 totaled $2.9 billion, a $1.6 billion decrease compared to Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015
primarily as a result of the factors discussed above. Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 totaled $4.5 billion, a $6.1 billion decrease compared to
Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of the factors discussed above.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP  financ ial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a
more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since purchases of fixed
assets are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for
discretionary expenditur es. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made  on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business
acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow is
calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities.
The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to Free cash flow:
 
   (dollars in millions)  
Years Ended December 31,   2016    2015    2014  
Net cash provided by operating activities   $    22,715     $    38,930     $    30,631   
Less Capital expenditures (including capitalized software)    17,059      17,775      17,191   
     
Free cash flow   $ 5,656     $21,155     $13,440   
     
The changes in free cash flow during 2016, 2015 and 2014 were a result of the factors described in connection with net cash provided by operating activities and
capital expe nditures. The change in free cash flow during 2016 was primarily due to a chang e in the method in which we monetize device payment plan
receivables, as discussed below , as well as a decli ne in earnings, an increase in income taxes paid primarily as a result of the Access Line Sale, and $2.4 billion of
cash proceeds received in 2015 related to the T ower Monetization T ransaction with American T ower .
During 2016, we chang ed the method in which we monetize device payment plan receivables  from sales of device payment plan receivables, which were
recorded within cash flows provided by operat ing activities, to asset-backed securitization transactions, which are recorded in cash flows from financing
activities. During 2016, we received cash proce eds related to new sales of wireless device payment plan agreement receivables of $2.0 billion and collected
$1.1 billion of deferred purchase price. During 2015, we received $7.2 billion of cash proceeds related to new sales of wireless device payment plan agreement
receivables. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. During 2016, we received proceeds from asset-backed securitization
transactions of $5.0 billion. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements and “Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities” for more information.
During 2015 , we received $5.9 billion of cash proceeds, net of remittances, related to the sale of wireless device payment plan receivables as well as $2.4 billion
of cash proceeds received related to the T ower Monetization T ransaction.
Employee Benefit Plan Funded Status and Contributions
Employer Contributions
We operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These plans primarily relate to our domestic business units.
During 2016, 2015 and 2014, contributions to our qualified pension plans were $0.8 billion, $0.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively . We also contributed
$0.1 billion to our nonqualified pension plans each year in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
In an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we have adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to
better match  cash flows from investments with projected benefit payments. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline at a time
when liabilit ies increase  (referred to as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and its participants and beneficiaries;
however , we also expect the strategy to result in lower asset returns. Based on this strategy and the funded status of the plans at December 31, 2016, we expect the
minimum required qualified pension plan contribution in 2017 to be $0.6 billion. Nonqualified pension contributions are estimated to be approximately
$0.1 billion in 2017.
Contributions to our other postretirement benefit  plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an as-incurred  basis since these other postretirement benefit
plans do not have funding requirements similar to the pension plans. We contributed $1.1 billion, $0.9 billion and $0.7 billion to our other postretirement benefit
plans in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively . Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $0.8 billion in 2017.

Items included in long-term debt with variable coupon rates are described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
 
See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
 
The purchas e obligations reflected above are primarily commitments to purchase programming and network services, equipment, software and marketing
services, which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but
represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. For this
reason, the amounts presented in this table alone  do not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows or changes in our expected cash
position (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements).
 
Other long-term liabilities include estimated postretirement benefit and qualified pension plan contributions (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial
statements).

We are not able to make a reliable estimate of when the unrecognized tax benefits balance of $1.9 billion and related interest and penalties will be settled with the

Guarantees
We guarantee the debentures of our operating telephone company subsidiaries as well as the debt obligations of GTE LLC, as successor in interest to GTE
Corporation, that were issued and outstanding prior to July 1, 2003 (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).
As a result of the closing  of the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016, GTE Southwest Inc., Verizon California Inc. and Verizon Florida LLC are no longer wholly-
owned subsi diaries of Verizon, and the guarantees of $0.6 billion aggregate principal amount of debentures and first mortgage bonds of those entities have
terminated pursuant to their terms.
In connection with the execution of agreements for the sale of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the
purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as financial losses (see Note 15 to the
consolidated financial statements).
As of December 31, 2016, letters of credit totaling approximately $0.4 billion, which were executed in the normal course of business and support several
financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements).
 
Market Risk
We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations, changes in investment, equity and commodity prices and changes in corporate tax rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include
the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, foreign currency and prepaid forwards and collars, interest rate swap agreements, and interest
rate caps. W e do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.
It is our gene ral policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary to achieve our desired objectives
in optimizing exposure to various market risks.  Our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within
reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market conditions. We do not hedge our market risk
exposure in a manner that would completely eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings. At December 31, 2016
and 2015, we posted collateral of approximately $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively , related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements.
During 2015, we paid an immaterial amount of cash to enter into amendments to certain collat eral exchange arrangements. These amendments suspend cash
collateral posting for a specified period of time by both counterparties. We are in the process of negotiating extensions to amendments expiring during 2017.
While we may be expos ed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk remote. As such, we do not expect that our
results of operations or financial condition will be materially af fected by these risk management strategies.
 
Inter est Rate Risk
We are exposed to chan ges in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating interest rates. As of
December 31, 2016, approximately 78% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfo lio consisted of fixed rate indebtedness, including the effect of
interest rate swap agreements designated as hedges. The impact of a 100 basis point change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a
change in annual interest expense, including our interest rate swap agreements that are designated  as hedges, of approximately $0.3 billion. The interest rates on
substantially all of our existing long-term debt obligations are unaf fected by changes to our credit ratings.
The table that follows summarizes the fair values  of our long-term debt, including current maturit ies, and interest rate swap derivatives as of December 31, 2016
and 2015. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of these  financial instruments assuming 100-basis-point  upward and
downward shifts in the yield curve. Our sensitivi ty analysis does not include the fair values of our commercial paper and bank loans, if any, because they are not
significantly af fected by changes in market interest rates.

At December 31, 2015    117,943      108,992      128,641   
Inter est Rate Swaps
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates based on the
London Interbank Offered Rate, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. Thes e swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against
interest rate risk exposu re of designated debt issuances. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair value of these contracts was $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion,
respectively , which was primarily included within  Other liabilities and Other assets, respectively , on our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2016 and
2015, the total notional amount of the interest rate swaps was $13.1 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively .
Forwar d Inter est Rate Swaps
In order to manage our exposure to future intere st rate changes, we have entered into forward interest rate swaps. We designated these contracts as cash flow
hedges. The fair value of these contracts, which was included within Other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, was not material at December 31, 2015.
At December 31, 2015, these swaps had a notional value of $0.8 billion. During 2016, we settled all outstanding forward interest rate swaps.
Inter est Rate Caps
We also have interest rate caps which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting. During 2016, we entered into
interest rate caps to mitig ate our interest exposure to interest rate increases on our ABS Financin g Facility . The fair value of these contracts was not material at
December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the total notional value of these contracts was $2.5 billion.
 
Foreign Curr ency T ranslation
The function al currency for our foreign operation s is primarily the local currency . The translation of income statement and balance sheet amounts of our foreign
operations into U.S. dollars is recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in our
consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are recorded in the consolidated statements of income in Other income and
(expense), net. At December 31, 2016, our primary translation exposure was to the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Australian Dollar and Japanese Y en.
Cross Curr ency Swaps
We enter into cross currency swaps to exchange British Pound Sterling and Euro-denominated debt into U.S. dollars and to fix our future interest and principal
payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the ef fect of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. The fair
value of the outstanding swaps, which was prim arily included within Other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, was $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion at
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively . At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the total notional amount of the cross currency swaps was $12.9 billion and
$9.7 billion, respectively .
Net Investment Hedges
We have designated certain foreign currency instruments as net investment hedges to mitiga te foreign exchange exposure related to non-U.S.  dollar net
investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign exchange rates. The fair value of these contracts was not material at December 31, 2015. At
December 31, 2015, the total notional value of these contracts was $0.9 billion. During 2016, we settled these net investment hedges and designated $0.8 billion
total notional value of Euro-denominated debt as a net investment hedge.
 
Critical Accounting Estimates and Recently Issued Accounting Standards
 
Critical Accounting Estimates
A summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements is as follows:
 
• Wireless licenses and Goodwill are a significant component of our consolidated assets. Both our wireless licenses and goodwill are treated as indefinite-lived
intangible assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter , unless there are events requiring an
earlier asses sment or changes in circumstances during an interim period that indicate these assets may not be recoverable. We believe our estimates and
assumptions are reasonable and represent appropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date. Although we use consistent methodologies in
developing the assumptions and estimates underly ing the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates and assumptions are uncertain by
nature, may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is possible that in the future  there may be changes in our estimates and assumptions,
including the timing and amount of future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market participant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies and related
multiples and discount rates, which could result  in different fair value estimates. Significant and adverse changes to any one or more of the above noted
estimates and assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting units.
Wireless Licenses
The carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately $86.7 billion as of December 31, 2016. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit
of accountin g, as we utilize our wireless licenses  on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network. Our wireless licenses provide us with the
exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. There are currently no legal, regulatory , contractual,
competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses.
In 2016 and 2014, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses
was less than the carrying amount. As part of our assessment we considered several qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of Wireless,
macroeconomic conditio ns (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and
EBITDA margin projections), the projected financial performance of Wireless, as well as other factors. Based on our assessments in 2016 and 2014, we
qualitatively concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless license s significantly exceeded their carrying value and, therefore,
did not result in an impairment.
In 2015, our quantitative  impairment test consiste d of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount
as of the test date. If the estimated fair value of our aggregated wireless licenses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses then an
impairment charge would have been recognized.  Our quantitative impairment test for 2015 indicated that the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying
value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.
In 2015, using a quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an
income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up  company that
goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant
would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregate d wireless licenses as of the valuation date. As a result, we were required to make significant estimates about
future cash flows specifically associated with our wireless licenses, an appropriate discount rate based on the risk associated with those estimated cash flows
and assumed  terminal value and growth rates. We considered current and expected future economic conditions, current and expected availability of wireless
network technology and infrastructure and related equipment and the costs thereof as well as other relevant factors in estimating future cash flows. The
discount rate represented our estimate of the weig hted-average cost of capital (WACC), or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required
as of the valuation date. We developed the discount rate based on our consideration of the cost of debt and equity of a group of guideline companies as of the
valuation date. Accordin gly, our discount rate incorporated our estimate of the expected return a marketplace participant would have required as of the
valuation date, including the risk premium associated with the current and expected economic conditions as of the valuation date. The terminal value growth
rate represented our estimate of the marketplace’ s long-term growth rate.
Goodwill
At December 31, 2016, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $27.2 billion, of which $18.4 billion was in our Wireless reporting unit, $3.8 billion
was in our Wireline reporting unit, $2.7 billion was in our digital media reporting unit and $2.3 billion was in our other reporting units. To determine if
goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determ ine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if indications of a potential impairment exist, the determination
of whether an impairment has occurred requires the determination of fair value of each respective reporting unit.
In 2016, we performed a qualitative assessment for our Wireless reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the
reporting unit was less than the carrying amount. As part of our assessment we considered several qualitative factors, including the business enterprise value of
Wireless from  the last quantitative test and the excess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest
rates and discount rates), industry and market  considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin projections), the projected financial
performance of Wireless, as well as other factors. Based on our assessments in 2016, we qualitati vely concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair
value of the W ireless reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.
We performed a quantita tive impairment assessment for our Wireless reporting unit in 2015 and 2014 and for our Wireline and other reporting units in 2016,
2015 and 2014. For each year, our quantitative impairment tests indicated that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value and
therefore, did not result in an impairment. In the event of a 10% decline in the fair value of any of our reporting units, the fair value of each of our reporting
units would have still exceeded their book value. However , the excess of fair value over carrying value for both our Wireline and digital media reporting units
continues to decline such that it is reasonably possible that small changes to our valuation inputs,  such as a decline in actual or projected operating results or
an increase in discount rates, could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future.
Under our quantitative assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a market approach and a discounted cash flow method. The market
approach includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present
value of two components—projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting
unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the
cash flows from the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represented our estimate of the WACC, or expected return,
that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date.
• We maintain  benefit plans for most of our employees, including, for certain employees, pension and other postretirement benefit plans. At December 31, 2016,
in the aggregate, pension plan benefit obligations  exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets, which will result in higher future pension plan expense. Other
postretirement benefit plans have larger benefit obligations than plan assets, resulting in expense. Significant benefit plan assumptions, including the discount
rate used, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the determination of the substantive plan and health care trend rates are periodically updated and impact
the amount of benefit plan income, expense, asset s and obligations. Changes to one or more of these assumptions could significantly impact our accounting for
pension and other postretirement benefits. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in these assumptions on the benefit obligations and expense (income)
recorded, as well as on the funded status due to an increase or a decrease in the actual versus expected return on plan assets as of December 31, 2016 and for
the year then ended pertaining to V erizon’ s pension and postretirement benefit plans, is provided in the table below .

 *In determining its pensi on and other postretirem ent obligation, the Company used a weighted-average discount rate of 4.2%. The rate was selected to
approximate the composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at December 31, 2016. The bonds selected
had maturities that coinc ided with the time periods during which benefits payments are expected to occur , were non-callable  and available in sufficient
quantities to ensure marketability (at least $0.3 billion par outstanding).
The annual measurement date for both our pension and other postretirement benefits is December 31. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted the full yield
curve approa ch to estimate the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. We accounted for this change
as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly , accounted for it prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. Prior to this change, we estimated the
interest cost component utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning
of the period.
The full yield curve approach refines our estimat e of interest cost by applying the individual spot rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on
several hund red high-qua lity fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date. These individual spot rates align with the timing of each future
cash outflow for benefit payments and therefore provide a more precise estimate of interest cost.
This change in accountin g estimate does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligatio ns at year end or our annual net periodic benefit cost as the
change in the interest cost is offset in the actuarial gain or loss recorded at year end. Accordingly , this change in accounting estimate has no impact on our
annual conso lidated GAA P results. For the year ended December 31, 2016, this change resulted in our reduction of the interest cost component of net periodic
benefit cost of approxim ately $0.4 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of this change on our non-GAAP  measures was an increase to
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $0.4 billion. Our non-GAAP  meas ure for Segment EBITDA is unaffected because the interest cost
component of net periodic benefit cost is not included in our segment results. For additional discus sion of Non-GAAP  measures and non-operational  items see
“Consolidated Results of Operations”.
 
• Our current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as
well as in connection with the adoption of new accounting standards, changes in tax laws and rates, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and
non-recurring  items. As a global comm ercial enterprise, our income tax rate and the classification of income taxes can be affected by many factors, including
estimates of the timing and realization of deferred income tax assets and the timing and amount of income tax payments. We account for tax benefits taken or
expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance with the accounting standard relating to the uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the use of a
two-step  approach for recognizing  and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We review and adjust our liability for unrecognized
tax benefits based on our best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at each reporting date. To the extent that the final outcome of
these tax positions is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact income tax expense and actual tax payments. We recognize any interest
and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Actual tax payments may materially differ from estimated liabilities as a
result of changes in tax laws as well as unanticipated transactions impacting related income tax balances.
• Our Plant, property and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. We record Plant, property and equipment at cost. We
depreciate Plant, property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. We expect that a one-year  increase in estimated
useful lives of our Plant , property and equipmen t would result in a decrease to our 2016 deprec iation expense of $2.8 billion and that a one-year  decrease
would result in an increase of approximately $5.7 billion in our 2016 depreciation expense.
 
• We maintain allowances for uncollectible accoun ts receivable, including our device payment plan receivables, for estimated losses resulting from the failure or
inability of our customers to make required payments. Our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is based on management’ s assessment of the
collectability of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those customers. We record an
allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. We also record an allowance for all other receivables based on
multiple factors, includin g historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration
of our customers’ financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, we may have to adjust
our allowance for doubtful accounts, which would af fect earnings in the period the adjustments are made.
 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Acquisitions and Divestitur es
Wireless
Wireless T ransaction
On February  21, 2014, we completed the Wireles s Transaction for aggregate consideration of approximately $130 billion. The consideration paid was primarily
comprised of cash of approximately $58.89 billion, V erizon common stock with a value of approximately $61.3 billion and other consideration.
Omnitel T ransaction
On February  21, 2014, Verizon and Vodafone also consummated the sale of the Omnitel Interest by a subsidiary of Verizon to a subsidiary of Vodafone in
connection with the Wireless Transaction pursuant to a separate share purchase agreement. As a result, during 2014, we recognized a pre-tax  gain of $1.9 billion
on the disposal of the Omnitel interest.
See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the W ireless T ransaction.
Spectrum License T ransactions
In January 2015, the FCC completed an auction  of 65 MHz of spectrum in the AWS-3  band. We participated in the auction and were the high bidder on 181
spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. The FCC granted us these spectrum licenses in April 2015.
During the fourth quarter of 2016, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of AT&T to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses.
As a result of this agreement, $0.9 billion of Wireless licenses are classified as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. This
non-cash  exchange was completed in February 2017. W e expect to record a gain on this transaction in the first quarter of 2017.
From time to time, we enter into agreements to buy, sell or exchange spectrum licenses. We believe these spectrum license transactions have allowed us to
continue to enhance the reliability of our network  while also resulting in a more efficient use of spectrum. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional details regarding our spectrum license transactions.
Tower  Monetization T ransaction
During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower pursuant to which Ame rican Tower acquired the exclusive right to lease, acquire or
otherwise operate and manage many of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.1 billion , which also included payment for the sale of 162 towers. See
Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Wireline
Access Line Sale
On February 5, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier pursuant to which Verizon agreed to sell its local exchange business and related
landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed Internet service
and long distance voice  accounts in these three states, for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.3 billion net of income taxes), subject to certain
adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier . The transaction, which included the acquisition by Frontier of
the equity interests of Verizon’ s ILECs in Califo rnia, Florida and Texas, did not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The transaction closed on
April 1, 2016. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Other
During July 2014, we sold a non-strategic  Wireline business for cash consideration that was not significant. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements
for additional information.
On February 20, 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire XO Holdings’ wireline business, which owns and operates one of the largest fiber-based
IP and Ethernet networks , for approximately $1.8 billion, subject to adjustment. We completed the acquisition on February 1, 2017. Separately , we entered into an
agreement to lease certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO Holdings that holds its wireless spectrum. Verizon has an option, exercisable
under certain circumstances, to buy that subsidiary .
On December 6, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with Equinix pursuant to which Verizon will sell 24 customer -facing data center sites in the United
States and Latin America, for approximately $3.6 billion, subject to certain adjustments. The sale does not affect Verizon’ s data center services delivered from 27
sites in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Canada, or its managed hosting and cloud offerings. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing
conditions, and is expected to close during the first half of 2017.
Other
Acquisition of Y ahoo! Inc.’ s Operating Business
On July 23, 2016, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Yahoo. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions thereof, we agree d to acquire the stock of one or more subsidiaries of Yahoo holding all of Yahoo’ s operating business for
approximately $4.83 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the Transaction). Prior to the closing of the Transaction, pursuant to a related reorganization
agreement, Yahoo will transfer all of the assets and liabilities constituting Yahoo’ s operating business to the subsidiaries to be acquired in the Transaction. The
assets to be acquired will not include Yahoo’ s cash, its ownership interests in Alibaba, Yahoo! Japan and certain other investments, certain undeveloped land
recently divested by Yahoo or certain non-core intellectual property . We will receive for our benefit and that of our current and certain future affiliates a non-
exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to all of Y ahoo’ s intellectual property that is not being conveyed with the business.
On February  20, 2017, Verizon and Yahoo enter ed into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Transaction purchase price will be
reduced by $350 million to approximately $4.48 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Subject to certain exceptions, the parties also agreed that certain
user security  and data breaches incurred by Yahoo (and the losses arising therefrom) will be disregarded (1) for purposes of specified conditions to Verizon’ s
obligations to close the T ransaction and (2) in determining whether a “Business Material Adverse Ef fect” under the Purchase Agreement has occurred.
Concurrently with the amendment of the Purchas e Agreement, Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Yahoo that Verizon has agreed to
purchase pursuant to the Transaction, also entered into an amendment to the related reorganization agreement, pursuant to which Yahoo (which has announced
that it intends to change its name to Altaba Inc. following the closing of the Transaction) will retain 50% of certain post-closing liabilities arising out of
governmental or third party investigations, litigations or other claims related to certain user security and data breaches incurred by Yahoo. In accordance with the
original Transaction agreements, Yahoo will continue to retain 100% of any liabilities arising out of any shareholder lawsuits (including derivative claims) and
investigations and actions by the SEC.
The Transac tion remains subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of Yahoo’ s stockholders, and is expected to close in the second quarter
of 2017.
Acquisition of AOL Inc.
On May 12, 2015, we entered into the Merger Agreement with AOL pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
common stock of AOL at a price of $50.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. On June 23, 2015, we
completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL  became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing
of these transactions was approximately $3.8 billion. Holders of approximately 6.6 million shares exercised their appraisal rights under Delaware law. If they had
not exercised these rights, V erizon would have paid an additional $330 million for such shares at the closing.
AOL is a leader in the digital content and advertising platform space. Verizon has been investing in emer ging technology that taps into the market shift to digital
content and advertising. AOL ’s business model aligns with this approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a
digital advertising platform enhances our ability  to further develop future revenue streams. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information.
Other
On July 29, 2016, we acquired T elogis, a global cloud-based mobile enterprise management software business, for $0.9 billion of cash consideration.
On July 30, 2016, we entered into an agreement (the Transaction Agreement) to acquire Fleetmat ics. Fleetmatics is a leading global provider of fleet and mobile
workforce management solutions. Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, we acquired Fleetmatics for $60.00 per ordinary share in cash. The
aggregate mer ger consideration was approximately $2.5 billion, including cash acquired of $0.1 billion. W e completed the acquisition on November 7, 2016.
During the fourth quarter of 2014, Redbox Instant by Verizon, a venture between Verizon and Redbox Automated Retail, LLC (Redbox), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Outerwall Inc., ceased providing service to its customers. In accordance with an agreement between the parties, Redbox withdrew from the venture
on October 20, 2014 and Verizon wound down and dissolved the venture during the fourth quarter of 2014. As a result of the termination of the venture, we
recorded a pre-tax  loss of $0.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.
From time to time, we enter into strategic agreem ents to acquire various other businesses and investments. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information.

Report of Independent Register ed Public Accounting Firm on Internal Contr ol Over Financial Reporting
To The Board of Dir ectors and Shar eowners of V erizon Communications Inc.:
We have audited Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries’ (Verizon) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria
established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the
COSO criteria). V erizon’ s management is responsible for maintaining ef fective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the ef fectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the company’ s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. W e believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of record s that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that recei pts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Verizon maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over finan cial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the COSO
criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Over sight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Verizon as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 and our report dated February 21, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Register ed Public Accounting Firm
To The Board of Dir ectors and Shar eowners of V erizon Communications Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries (Verizon) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015,
and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of Verizon’ s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducte d our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly , in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Verizon at December 31,
2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Verizon’ s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring

Note 1
Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Verizon Com munications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’ s leading providers of
communications, informa tion and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies with a presence around the world. We
have two reportable segments, W ireless and W ireline. For further information concerning our business segments, see Note 12.
The Wireless segment provides wireless communications services and products across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.).
We provide these services and equipment sales to consumer , business and government customers in the United States on a postpaid and prepaid basis.
The W ireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services, including broadband video and data, corporate networking
solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and
services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and around the world.
Consolidation
The method of accountin g applied to investmen ts, whether consolidated, equity or cost, involves an evaluation of all significant terms of the investments that
explicitly grant or suggest evidence of control or influence over the operations of the investee. The consolidated financial statements include our controlled
subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities (VIE) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary . For controlled subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned,
the noncontrolling interests are included in Net income and Total equity . Investments in businesses which we do not control, but have the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financial  policies, are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in which we do not have the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for under the cost method. Equity and cost method investments are included in
Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Basis of Pr esentation
We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.
Use of Estimates
We prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that af fect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could dif fer from those estimates.
Examples of significant estimates include: the allowance for doubtful accounts, the recoverab ility of plant, property and equipment, the recoverability of
intangible assets and other long-lived assets, fair values of financial instruments, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on tax assets, accrued expenses,
pension and postretirement benefit obligations, contingencies and the identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with
business combinations.
Revenue Recognition
Multiple Deliverable Arrangements
We offer products and services to our wireless and wireline customers through bundled arrangem ents. These arrangements involve multiple deliverables which
may include products, services, or a combination of products and services.
Wireless
Our Wireless segment earns revenue primarily by providing access to and usage of its network as well as the sale of equipment. In general, access revenue is
billed one month in adva nce and recognized when earned. Usage revenue is generally billed in arrears and recognized when service is rendered. Equipment sales
revenue associated with the sale of wireless devices and accessories is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer , as
this is consid ered to be a separate earnings proce ss from providing wireless services. For agreements involving the resale of third-party services in which we are
considered the primary obligor in the arrangements, we record the revenue gross at the time of the sale.
Under the Verizon device  payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase wireless devices under a device payment plan agreement. On select devices,
certain marketing promotions have been revocably offered to customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down a certain specified portion of the required
device paym ent plan agreement amount as well as trading in their device in good working order . When a customer enters into a device payment plan agreement
with the right to upgrade to a new device, we account for this trade-in  right as a guarantee obligation. The full amount  of the trade-in  right’s fair value (not an
allocated value) is recognized as a guarantee liability and the remaining allocable consideration is allocated to the device. The value of the guarantee liability
effectively results in a reduction to the revenue recognized for the sale of the device.
We may offer our customers certain promotions where a customer can trade-in  his or her owned device  in connection with the purchase of a new device. Under
these types of promotions, the customer will receive trade-in  credits that are applied to the customer ’s monthly bill. As a result, we recognize a trade-in  obligation
measured at fair value using weighted-average selling prices obtained in recent resales of devices eligible for trade-in.
In multiple element arran gements that bundle devices and monthly wireless service, revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting using a relative selling price
method. At the inception  of the arrangement, the amount allocable to the delivered units of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the
delivery of the monthly wireless service (the noncontingent amount). We effectively recognize revenue on the delivered device at the lesser of the amount
allocated based on the relative selling price of the device or the noncontingent amount owed when the device is sold.
Wireline
Our Wireline segment earns revenue based upon usage of its network and facilities and contract fees. In general, fixed monthly fees for voice, video, data and
certain other  services are billed one month in advance and recognized when earned. Revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and are based on usage is
generally billed in arrears and recognized when service is rendered.
We sell each of the servic es offered in bundled arrangements (i.e., voice, video and data), as well as separately; therefore each product or service has a standalone
selling price. For these arrangements, revenue is allocated to each deliverable using a relative sellin g price method. Under this method, arrangement consideration
is allocated to each separ ate deliverable based on our standalone selling price for each product or service. These services include Fios services, individually or in
bundles, and high-speed Internet.
When we bundle equipm ent with maintenance and monitoring services, we recognize equipment revenue when the equipment is installed in accordance with
contractual specifications and ready for the customer ’s use. The maintenance and monitoring services are recognized monthly over the term of the contract as we
provide the services.
Installation-related fees, along with the associated costs up to but not exceeding these fees, are deferred and amortized over the estimated customer relationship
period.
Other
Advertising revenues are generated through display advertising and search advertising. Display advertising revenue is generated by the display of graphical
advertisements and other performance-based advertising. Search advertising revenue is generated when a consumer clicks on a text-based advertisement on their
screen. Agreements for advertising typically take the forms of impression-based contracts, time-based contracts or performance-based contracts. Advertising
revenues derived from impression-based contracts, in which we provide impressions in exchange for a fixed fee, are generally recognized as the impressions are
delivered. Advertising revenues derived from time-based contracts, in which we provide promotions over a specified time period for a fixed fee, are recognized
on a straight -line basis over the term of the contract, provided that we meet and will continue to meet our obligations under the contract. Advertising revenues
derived from contracts where we are compensated based on certain performance criteria are recognized as we complete the contractually specified performance.
We report taxes imposed  by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions between us and our customers, which we pass through to our customers,
on a net basis.
Maintenance and Repairs
We charge the cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of replacing minor items not constituting substantial betterments, principally to Cost of services
as these costs are incurred.
Advertising Costs
Costs for advertising products and services as well as other promotional and sponsorship costs are charged to Selling, general and administrative expense in the
periods in which they are incurred (see Note 14).
Earnings Per Common Shar e
Basic earnings per comm on share are based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Where appropriate, diluted earnings per
common share include the dilutive ef fect of shares issuable under our stock-based compensation plans.
There were a total of approximately 6 million, 8 million and 7 million outstanding dilutive securities, primarily consisting of restricted stock units, included in the
computation of diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively . For the years ended December 31, 2016
and 2015, respectively , there were no outstanding  options to purchase shares that would have been anti-dilutive. Outstanding options to purchase shares that were
not included in the computation of diluted earnin gs per common share, because to do so would have been anti-dilutive for the period, were not significant for the
year ended December 31, 2014.
On January 28, 2014, at a special meeting of our shareholders, we received shareholder approval to increase our authorized shares of common stock by 2 billion
shares to an aggregate of 6.25 billion authorized shares of common stock. On February 4, 2014, this authorization became effective. On February 21, 2014, we
issued appro ximately 1.27 billion shares of common stock upon completing the acquisition of Vodafone Group Plc’s (Vodafone) indirect 45% interest in Cellco
Partnership d/b/a V erizon W ireless. See Note 2 for additional information.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider  all highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
approximates quoted market value and include amounts held in money market funds.
Marketable Securities
We have investments in marketable securities, which are considered “available-for -sale”  under the provisions of the accounting standard  for certain debt and
equity secur ities and are included in the accom panying consolidated balance sheets in Short-term investments or Other assets. We continually evaluate our
investments in marketable securities for impairment due to declines in market value considered to be other -than-temporary . That evaluation includes, in addition
to persistent, declining stock prices, general econ omic and company-specific evaluations. In the event of a determination that a decline in market value is other -
than-temporary , a char ge to earnings is recorded for the loss and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable are recorded in the consolida ted financial statements at cost net of an allowance for credit losses, with the exception of device payment plan
agreement receivables which are initially recorde d at fair value. We maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our device payment plan
agreement receivables, for estimated losses resul ting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Our allowance for uncollectible
accounts receivable is based on management’ s assessment of the collectability of specific custom er accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness
and financial condition of those customers. We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. We also
record an allowance for all other receivables based on multiple factors including historical experie nce with bad debts, the general economic environment and the
aging of such receivable s. Similar to traditional service revenue accounting treatment, we record device payment plan agreement bad debt expense based on an
estimate of the percentag e of equipment revenue that will not be collected. This estimate is based on a number of factors including historical write-of f experience,
credit quality of the customer base and other factors such as macroeconomic conditions. Due to the device payment plan agreement being incorporated in the
standard V erizon W ireless bill, the collection and risk strategies continue to follow historical practices. W e monitor the aging of our accounts with device payment
plan agreement receivables and write-of f account balances if collection ef forts are unsuccessful and future collection is unlikely .
Inventories
Inventory consists of wireless and wireline equipment held for sale, which is carried at the lowe r of cost (determined principally on either an average cost or
first-in,  first-out  basis) or market.
Plant and Depr eciation
We record plant, property and equipment at cost. Plant, property and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the improvement or the remaining term of the related lease, calculated from the
time the asset was placed in service.
When deprec iable assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are deducted from the plant accounts and any gains or
losses on disposition are recognized in income.
We capitalize and deprec iate network software purchased or developed along with related plant assets. We also capitalize interest associated with the acquisition
or construction of netwo rk-related assets. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in intere st expense and depreciated as part of the cost of the network-
related assets.
In connection with our ongoing review of the estimated useful lives of plant, property and equipm ent during 2016, we determined that the average useful lives of
certain lease hold improvements would be increa sed from 5 to 7 years. This change resulted in a decrease to depreciation expense of $0.2 billion in 2016. We
determined that changes were also necessary to the remaining estimated useful lives of certain assets as a result of technology upgrades, enhancements, and
planned retirements. These changes resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of $0.3 billion, $0.4 billion and $0.6 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively . While the timing and extent of current deployment plans are subject to ongoing analy sis and modification, we believe the current estimates of useful
lives are reasonable.
Computer Softwar e Costs
We capitalize the cost of internal-use  netwo rk and non-network  software that has a useful life in excess of one year. Subsequent additions, modifications or
upgrades to internal-use  network and non-network  software are capitalized  only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previo usly did not
perform. Planning, softw are maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Also, we capitalize interest associated with the
development of internal-use  network and non-network  software. Capitalized non-network  internal-use  software costs are amortized using the straight-line method
over a period of 3 to 8 years and are included in Other intangible assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. For a discussion of our impairment policy for
capitalized software costs, see “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” below . Also, see Note  3 for additional detail of internal-use  non-network  software
reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of businesses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed
annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option
to perform a qualitative assessment. However , we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform an impairment test even if no indications of a
potential impairment exist. The impairment test for goodwill uses a two-step  approach, which is performed at the reporting unit level. Step one, performed to
identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using a market approach and/or a discounted cash flow method) to its
carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, there is a potential impairment and step two must be performed to measure the amount of the
impairment charge. Step two compares the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its implied fair value (i.e., fair value of reporting unit less the fair
value of the unit’s assets and liabilities, including  identifiable intangible assets). If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount of goodwill,
an impairment charge is recognized. Our assessments in 2016, 2015 and 2014 indicated that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying
value and therefore, did not result in an impairment.
Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization
A significant portion of our intangible assets are wireless licenses that provide our wireless operations with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio
frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten years, such licenses are subject to
renewal by the Federal Communications Commis sion (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover , we have determined that
there are currently no legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. As a result, we treat
the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We re-evaluate  the useful life determin ation for wireless licens es each year to determine whether
events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our
wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network.
We test our wireless licenses for potential impai rment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to first perform a
qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However , we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment
in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. In 2016 and 2014, we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether
it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carryin g amount. As part of our assessment, we considered several
qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of our Wireless segment, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount
rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin
projections), the projected financial performance of our Wireless segment, as well as other factors. The most recent quantitative assessments of our wireless
licenses occurred in 2015. Our quantitative assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated
carrying amount as of the test date. Using a quant itative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach.
The Greenfi eld approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a
hypothetical start-up  company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate
what a marketplace participant would be willing  to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the
aggregated wireless licen ses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses then an impairment charge is recognized. Our assessments in
2016, 2015 and 2014 indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.
Interest expense incurred while qualifying activit ies are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The
capitalization period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially complete and the license is ready for its intended use.
Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets
Our intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network  internal-use  software) are amortized  over their estimated useful
lives. All of our intangib le assets subject to amortization and long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount  of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications were present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount
of the asset group to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the
carrying amount, we would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment, if any. We re-evaluate  the useful life
determinations for these intangible assets each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.
For information related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major components and average useful lives
of our other acquired intangible assets, see Note 3.
Fair Value Measur ements
Fair value of financial and non-financial  assets  and liabilities is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction betw een market participants. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the
inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows:
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 3—No observable pricing inputs in the market
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Our
assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities
being measured and their categorization within the fair value hierarchy .

Our effective tax rate is based on pre-tax  income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various
jurisdictions in which we operate.
Deferred income taxes are provided for tempora ry differences in the basis between financial statement and income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income
taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates then in effect. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than
not to be realized.
We use a two-step  approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is recognition: we determine
whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based
on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not  recog nition threshold, we presume that the posit ion
will be exam ined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that
meets the more-likely-than-not  recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financia l statements. The tax position is
measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken
in a tax return and amou nts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in one or more of the following: an increase in a liability for income taxes
payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability .
Significant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our ef fective tax rate.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure and recogni ze compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. See
Note 9 for further details.
Foreign Curr ency T ranslation
The function al currency of our foreign operation s is generally the local currency . For these foreign entities, we translate income statement amounts at average
exchange rates for the period, and we translate assets and liabilities at end-of-period  excha nge rates. We record these translation adjustments in Accumulated
other comprehensive income, a separate compon ent of Equity , in our consolidated balance sheets. We report exchange gains and losses on intercompany foreign
currency transactions of a long-term nature in Accumulated other comprehensive income. Other exchange gains and losses are reported in income.
Employee Benefit Plans
Pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits earned during the year as well as interest on projected benefit obligations are accrued currently .
Prior service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are generally amortized over the average remaining service period of the employees
expected to receive bene fits. Expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the retur n on assets assumption to the actual fair value of plan assets.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in operating results in the year in which they occur . These gains and losses are measured annually as of December 31 or
upon a remeasurement event. Verizon management employees no longer earn pension benefits or earn service towards the company retiree medical subsidy (see
Note 10).
We recogniz e a pension or a postretirement plan’ s funded status as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets. Also, we measure any
unrecognized prior service costs and credits that arise during the period as a component of Accum ulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income
tax.
Derivative Instruments
We enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We employ risk
management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, foreign currency and prepaid forwards and collars,
interest rate swap agreements and interest rate caps. W e do not hold derivatives for trading purposes. See Note 8.
We measure all derivativ es at fair value and recog nize them as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our derivative instruments are valued
primarily using models based on readily observa ble market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative contracts and thus are classified as Level 2.
Changes in the fair value s of derivative instrumen ts not qualifying as hedges or any ineffective portion of hedges are recognized in earnings in the current period.
Changes in the fair value s of derivative instruments used effectively as fair value hedges are recognized in earnings, along with changes in the fair value of the
hedged item. Changes in the fair value of the effective portions of cash flow hedges are reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in
earnings when the hedge d item is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the effective portion of net investment hedges of certain of our foreign
operations are reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment and partially offset the impact of foreign currency
changes on the value of our net investment.
Variable Inter est Entities
VIEs are entities which lack suf ficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, have
equity investors which do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’ s operations through voting rights, do not have the obligation to
absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity . We consolidate the assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are
deemed to be the primary  beneficiary . The primar y beneficiary is the party which has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic
performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
During the first quarter of 2016, we adopted the accounting standard update related to the simplification of the accounting for measurement-period adjustments in
business combinations. This standard update requires an acquirer to recognize measurement-period adjustments in the reporting period in which the adjustments
are determin ed and to record the effects on earnings of any changes resulting from the change in provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been
completed at the acquisition date. The prospective adoption of this standard update did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
During the first quarter of 2016, we adopted the accounting standard update related to disclosures  for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value
(NAV) per share. This standard update removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured
using the NAV per share  practical expedient. The standard update limits the required disclosures to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the
fair value using the practical expedient. The retrospective adoption of this standard update impact ed our presentation of pension and other postretirement benefit
plan assets in the notes to the consolidated financial statements but did not have an impact on the measurement of the assets.
During the first quarter of 2016, we adopted the accounting standard update related to the simplification of the presentation of debt issuance costs. This standard
update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of
that debt liability . During  the first quarter of 2016, we also adopted the accounting standard update related to the presentation and subsequent measurement of
debt issuance costs assoc iated with line-of-credit  arrangements. This standard adds Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paragraphs pursuant to an SEC
Staff Announcement that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs associated with a line-of-credit  arrangement as
an asset and subsequent ly amortizing the costs ratably over the term of the arrangement. We applied the amendments in these accounting standard updates
retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption of these standard updates did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
During the first quarter of 2016, we adopted the accounting standard update related to the accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award
provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. The standard  requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that
could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. The prospective adoption of this standard update did not have an impact
on our consolidated financial statements.
During the second quarter of 2016, we prospectively changed our method for determining the date at which we remeasure plan assets and obligations as a result
of a signific ant event during an interim period in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-04,  Compensation – Retir ement Benefits (Topic
715): Practical Expedient for the Measur ement Date of an Employer ’s Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets . As a pract ical expedie nt, we elected to
remeasure defined benef it plan assets and obligations using the month-end  that is close st to the date of the significant event. While this standard update may
impact the amounts recognized in an interim period as the result of a remeasurement, the adoption  of this standard update did not impact our annual consolidated
financial statements as the employee benefit obligations are measured annually as of December 31.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In January 2017, the accounting standard update related to the simplification of the accounting for goodwill impairment was issued. The amendments in this
update elimi nate the requirement to perform step two of the goodwill impairment test, whic h requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation when an
impairment is determined to have occurred. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not
to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. This standard update is effective as of the first quarter of 2020; however , early adoption is permitted for any interim or
annual impa irment tests performed after January 1, 2017. Verizon expects to early adopt this standard as of January 1, 2017. The prospective adoption of this
standard update is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In November 2016, the accounting standard update related to the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash was issued. The amendments in this
update requi re that cash and cash equivalent balances in a statement of cash flows include those amounts deemed to be restricted cash and restricted cash
equivalents. This standard update is effective as of the first quarter of 2018; however , early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that this
standard update will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In August 2016, the accounting standard update related to the classification of certain cash receipts  and cash payments was issued. This standard update addresses
eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice for these issues. Among the updates, this standard update requires
cash receipts  from payments on a transferor ’s beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables to be classified as cash inflows from investing activities. This
standard update is effective as of the first quarter  of 2018; however , early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that this standard update
will have on our consolid ated financial statements. We expect the amendment relating to beneficia l interests in securitization transactions will have an impact on
our presentation of collec tions of the deferred purchase price from sales of wireless device payme nt plan agreement receivables in our consolidated statements of
cash flows. Upon adoption of this standard update in the first quarter of 2018, we expect to retrospectively reclassify approximately $1.1 billion of collections of
deferred purchase price related to collections from customers for the year ended December 31, 2016 from Cash flows from operating activities to Cash flows
from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
In June 2016, the standard update related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments was issued. This standard update requires that certain
financial assets be measured at amortized cost reflecting an allowance for estimated credit losses expected to occur over the life of the assets. The estimate of
credit losses must be based on all relevant information including historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the
collectability of the amounts. This standard upda te is effective as of the first quarter of 2020; however , early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating
the impact that this standard update will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the accounting standard update related to employee share-based payment accounting was issued. This standard update intends to simplify several
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax conseque nces, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and
classification on the statement of cash flows. This standard update is effective as of the first quarte r of 2017. The retrospective adoption of this standard update is
not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the accounting standard update related to leases was issued. This standard upda te intends to increase transparency and improve comparability
by requiring  entities to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases, with certain exceptions. In addition, through improved disclosure
requirements, the standard update will enable users of financial statements to further understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from
leases. This standard update is effective as of the first quarter of 2019; however , early adoptio n is permitted. Verizon’ s current operating lease portfolio is
primarily comprised of network, real estate, and equipment leases. Upon adoption of this standard, we expect our balance sheet to include a right of use asset and
liability related to substantially all operating lease arrangements. We have established a cross-functional coordinated implementation team to implement the
standard update related to leases. We are in the process of assessing the impact to our systems, processes and internal controls to meet the standard update’ s
reporting and disclosure requirements.
In May 2014, the accounting standard update related to the recognition of revenue from contract s with customers was issued. This standard update along with
related subse quently issued updates clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP . The standard
update also amends current guidance for the recognition of costs to obtain and fulfill contracts with customers such that incremental costs of obtaining and direct
costs of fulfilling contrac ts with customers will be deferred and amortized consistent with the transfer of the related good or service. The standard update intends
to provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries,
jurisdictions, and capital markets; and provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements. The two
permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period
presented and the cumul ative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the earliest period shown, or the modified retrospective method, in which
case the standard is appli ed only to the most current period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial
application. In August 2015, an accounting standard update was issued that delayed the effective date of this standard until the first quarter of 2018, at which time
we plan to adopt the standard.
We are in process of evaluating the impact of the standard update. The ultimate impact on revenue resulting from the application of the new standard will be
subject to assessments that are dependent on many variables, including, but not limited to, the terms of our contractual arrangements and our
mix of busin ess. Upon adoption, we expect that the allocation of revenue between equipment and service for our wireless fixed-term service plans will result in
more revenue allocated to equipment and recog nized earlier as compared with current GAAP . We expect the timing of recognition of our sales commission
expenses will also be impacted, as a substantial portion of these costs (which are currently expensed) will be capitalized and amortized as described above. In
2016, total sales commission expenses were approximately $4.2 billion. In 2017, we expect total sales commission expenses to decline as our wireless customers
continue to migrate from  our fixed-term service plans to device payment plans which have lower commission structures. We continue to evaluate the available
transition methods. Our considerations include, but are not limited to, the comparability of our financial statements and the comparability within our industry
from application of the new standard to our contractual arrangements. W e plan to select a transition method by the second half of 2017.
We have established a cross-functional coordinated implementation team to implement the standard update related to the recognition of revenue from contracts
with customers. We have  identified and are in the process of implementing changes to our system s, processes and internal controls to meet the standard update’ s
reporting and disclosure requirements.
 
Note 2
Acquisitions and Divestitur es
Wireless
Wireless T ransaction
On September 2, 2013, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement) with Vodafone and Vodafone 4 Limited (Seller),
pursuant to which Verizo n agreed to acquire Vodafone’ s indirect 45% interest in Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless (the Partnership, and such interest, the
Vodafone Interest) for aggregate consideration of approximately $130 billion.
On February 21, 2014, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement, Verizon acquired (the Wireless Transaction)
from Seller all of the issued and outstanding capital stock (the Transferred Shares) of Vodafone Americas Finance 1 Inc., a subsidiary of Seller (VF1 Inc.), which
indirectly through certain subsidiaries (together with VF1 Inc., the Purchased Entities) owned the Vodafone Interest. In consideration for the Transferred Shares,
upon completion of the Wireless Transaction, Verizon (i) paid approximately $58.89 billion in cash, (ii) issued approximately 1.27 billion shares of Verizon’ s
common stock, par value $0.10 per share, which was valued at approximately $61.3 billion at the closing of the W ireless T ransaction, (iii) issued senior unsecured
Verizon notes in an aggre gate principal amount of $5.0 billion (the Verizon Notes), (iv) sold Verizon’s indirectly owned 23.1% interest in Vodafone Omnitel N.V.
(Omnitel, and such interest, the Omnitel Interest) , valued at $3.5 billion and (v) provided other consideration, which included the assumption of preferred stock
valued at approximately $1.7 billion. The total cash paid to Vodafone and the other costs of the Wireless Transaction, including financing, legal and bank fees,
were financed through the incurrence of third-party indebtedness.
In accordance with the accounting standard on consolidation, a change in a parent’ s ownership interest while the parent retains a controlling financial interest in
its subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and remeasurement of assets and liabilities of previously controlled and consolidated subsidiaries is not
permitted. As a result, we accounted for the Wireless Transaction by adjusting the carrying amount  of the noncontrolling interest to reflect the change in Verizon’ s
ownership interest in the Partnership. Any difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the amount by which the noncontrolling interest is
adjusted has been recognized in equity attributable to V erizon.
Omnitel T ransaction
On February 21, 2014, Verizon and Vodafone also consummated the sale of the Omnitel Intere st (the Omnitel Transaction) by a subsidiary of Verizon to a
subsidiary of Vodafone in connection with the Wireless Transaction pursuant to a separate share purchase agreement. As a result, during 2014, we recognized a
pre-tax  gain of $1.9 billion on the disposal of the Omnitel interest in Equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated businesses on our consolidated statement of
income.
Verizon Notes (Non-Cash  Transaction)
The Verizon Notes were issued pursuant to Verizo n’s existing indenture. The Verizon Notes were issued in two separate series, with $2.5 billion due February 21,
2022 (the eight-year Verizon Notes) and $2.5 billion due February 21, 2025 (the eleven-year Verizon Notes). The Verizon Notes bear interest at a floating rate,
which will be reset quarterly , with interest payabl e quarterly in arrears, beginning May 21, 2014. The eight-year Verizon notes bear interest at a floating rate equal
to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus 1.222%, and the eleven-year Verizon notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-
month LIBOR, plus 1.372%. On December 7, 2016, we redeemed the eight-year V erizon Notes (see Note 6 for additional details).
Other Consideration (Non-Cash  Transaction)
Included in the other consideration provided to Vodafone is the indirect assumption of long-term obligations with respect to 5.143% Class D and Class E
cumulative preferred stock issued by one of the Purchased Entities. Both the Class D shares (825,000 shares outstanding) and Class E shares
(825,000 shares outstanding) are mandatorily redeemable in April 2020 at $1,000 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Dividends accrue at 5.143%
per annum and will be treated as interest expense. Both the Class D and Class E shares have been classified as liability instruments and were recorded at fair
value as determined at the closing of the W ireless T ransaction.
Deferr ed Tax Liabilities
Certain deferred taxes directly attributable to the Wireless Transaction have been calculated based on an analysis of taxes attributable to the difference between
the tax basis  of the investment in the noncontrolling interest that is assumed compared to Verizon’ s book basis. As a result, Verizon recorded a deferred tax
liability of approximately $13.5 billion.
Spectrum License T ransactions
Since 2014, we have entered into several strategic spectrum transactions including:
 
 • During the second quarter of 2014, we completed license exchange transactions with T-Mobile  USA, Inc. (T-Mobile  USA) to exchange certain
Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) and Personal Communication Services (PCS) licenses. The exchange included a number of swaps that we expect
will result in more efficient use of the AWS and PCS bands. As a result of these exchanges, we received $0.9 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses
at fair value and we recorded an immaterial gain.
 
 • During the second quarter of 2014, we completed transactions pursuant to two additional agreements with T-Mobile  USA with respect to our remaining
700 MHz A block spectrum licenses. Under one agreement, we sold certain of these licenses to T-Mobile  USA in exchange for cash consideration of
approximately $2.4 billion, and under the second  agreement we exchanged the remainder of our 700 MHz A block spectrum licenses as well as AWS
and PCS spectrum licenses for AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. As a result, we received $1.6 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value
and we recorded a pre-tax  gain of approximately $0.7 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolida ted statement of income for
the year ended December 31, 2014.
 
 • During the third quarter of 2014, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of AT&T Inc. (AT&T) to exchange certain AWS and PCS
spectrum licenses. This non-cash  exchange was completed in January 2015 at which time we recorded an immaterial gain.
 
 • On January 29, 2015, the FCC completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum, which it identified as the AWS-3  band. Verizon participated in that auction
and was the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we made a
deposit of $0.9 billion related to our participation  in this auction which is classified within Other , net investing activities on our consolidated statement
of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, we submitted an application to the FCC and paid $9.5 billion to
the FCC to complete payment for these licenses. The cash payment of $9.5 billion is classif ied within Acquisitions of wireless licenses on our
consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015. On April 8, 2015, the FCC granted us these spectrum licenses.
 
 • During the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed a license exchange transaction with an affiliate of T-Mobile  USA to exchange certain AWS and PCS
spectrum licenses. As a result we received $0.4 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-tax  gain of approximately
$0.3 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2015.
 
 • During the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of AT&T to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum
licenses. This non-cash  excha nge was completed in March 2016. As a result, we received $0.4 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value
and recorded a pre-tax  gain of $0.1 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended
December 31, 2016.
 
 • During the first quarter of 2016, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of Sprint Corporation, which provides for the exchange of
certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. This non-cash  exchange was completed in September 2016. As a result, we received $0.3 billion of AWS and
PCS spectru m licenses at fair value and recorded  an immaterial gain in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of
income for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
 • During the fourth quarter of 2016, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of AT&T to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum
licenses. As a result of this agreement, $0.9 billion of Wireless licenses are classified as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2016. This non-cash  exchange was completed  in February 2017. We expect to record a gain on this transaction in the first quarter of 2017.
Tower  Monetization T ransaction
During Marc h 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive
rights to lease and operate approximately 1 1,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. Under the terms of the leases, American T ower has
exclusive rights to lease and operate the towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire,
American T ower has fixed-price purchase options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this
transaction, we also sold 162 towers for $0.1 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current
market rates, with options to renew . The upfron t payment, including the towers sold, which is primarily included within Other liabilities on our consolidated
balance sheet, is accounted for as deferred rent and as a financing obligation. The $2.4 billion accounted for as deferred rent, which is presented within Other , net
cash flows provided by operating activities, relates to the portion of the towers for which the right-of-use  has passed to the tower  operator . The $2.7 billion
accounted for as a financ ing obligation, which is presented within Other , net cash flows used in financing activities, relates to the portion of the towers that we
continue to occupy and use for network operations. See Note 5 for additional information.
Other
During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we acquired various other wireless licenses and markets for cash consideration that was not significant.
Wireline
Access Line Sale
On February 5, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to which Verizon sold its local
exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines
and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states, for approxi mately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.3 billion net of income
taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier (Access Line Sale). The transaction,
which includ ed the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon’ s incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and Texas, did not
involve any assets or liabilities of V erizon W ireless. The transaction closed on April 1, 2016.
The transaction resulted in Frontier acquiring approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video
subscribers and the related ILEC businesses from Verizon. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, these businesses generated revenues of
approximately $1.3 billion, $5.3 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively , and operating income of $0.7 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively , for Verizon.
The operating results of these businesses are excluded from our Wireline segment for all perio ds presented to reflect comparable segment operating results
consistent with the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker .
During April 2016, Verizon used the net cash proceeds received of $9.9 billion to reduce its consolidated indebtedness (see Note 6). The assets and liabilities that
were sold were included in Verizon’ s continuing operations and classified as assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale on our consolidated
balance sheets through the completion of the transaction on April 1, 2016. As a result of the closing of the transaction, we derecognized plant, property , and
equipment of $9.0 billion, goodwill of $1.3 billio n, $0.7 billion of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations and $0.6 billion of
indebtedness assumed by Frontier .
We recorded a pre-tax  gain of approximately $1.0 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year
ended Decem ber 31, 2016. The pre-tax  gain included a $0.5 billion pension and postretirement benefit curtailment gain due to the elimi nation of the accrual of
pension and other postretirement benefits for some or all future services of a significant number of employees covered by three of our defined benefit pension
plans and one of our other postretirement benefit plans.
XO Holdings
On February 20, 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire XO Holdings’ wireline business, which owns and operates one of the largest fiber-based
Internet Protocol (IP) and Ethernet networks, for approximately $1.8 billion, subject to adjustment. W e completed the acquisition on February 1, 2017. Separately ,
we entered into an agreement to lease certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO Holdings that holds its wireless spectrum. Verizon has an
option, exercisable under certain circumstances, to buy that subsidiary .
The acquisit ion of XO Holdings’ wireline business will be accounted for as a business combination. While we have commenced the appraisals necessary to
identify the tangible and intangible assets acquir ed and liabilities assumed and the amount of goodwill to be recognized as of the acquisition date, the initial
identification of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is not yet available.
Data Center Sale
On Decembe r 6, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with Equinix, Inc. (Equinix) pursuant to which Verizon will sell 24 customer -facing data center
sites in the United States  and Latin America, for approximately $3.6 billion, subject to certain adjustments. The sale does not affect Verizon’ s data center services
delivered from 27 sites in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Canada, or its managed hosting and cloud of ferings.
We plan to account for a portion of the transaction, consisting of the data center buildings, land and related assets, as a sale of real estate. The real estate assets to
be sold of $0.7 billion are currently included in Verizon’ s continuing operations and classified as held and used within Plant, property and equipment, net on our
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016. The non-real  estate assets and liabilities that will be sold are currently
included in Verizon’ s continuing operations and classified as assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as
of Decembe r 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, assets to be sold classified as Non-current  assets held for sale of $0.6 billion were principally comprised of
goodwill, plant, property and equipment and other intangible assets. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, and is
expected to close during the first half of 2017.
Other
On July 1, 2014, we sold a non-strategic  Wireline business that provides communications  solutions to a variety of government agencies for net cash proceeds of
$0.1 billion and recorded an immaterial gain.
During the fourth quarte r of 2015, we completed a sale of real estate for which we received total gross proceeds of $0.2 billion and recognized an immaterial
deferred gain. The proceeds received as a result of this transaction have been classified within  Cash flows used in investing activities on our consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Other
Acquisition of AOL Inc.
On May 12, 2015, we entered into an Agreement  and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with AOL Inc. (AOL) pursuant to which we commenced a tender
offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of AOL at a price of $50.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes.
On June 23, 2015, we completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by
Verizon at the closing of these transactions was approximately $3.8 billion. Holders of approximately 6.6 million shares exercised appraisal rights under Delaware
law. If they had not exercised these rights, V erizon would have paid an additional $330 million for such shares at the closing.
AOL is a leader in the digital content and advertising platform space. Verizon has been investing in emer ging technology that taps into the market shift to digital
content and advertising. AOL ’s business model aligns with this approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a
digital advertising platform enhances our ability to further develop future revenue streams.
The acquisition of AOL has been accounted for as a business combination. The identification of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are finalized. The fair
values of the assets acquired and liabilities assum ed were determined using the income, cost and market approaches. The fair value measurements were primarily
based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in Accounting Standards Codification
(ASC) 820, other than long-term debt assumed in the acquisition. The income approach was primarily used to value the intangible assets, consisting primarily of
acquired technology and customer relationships . The income approach indicates value for an asset based on the present value of cash flow projected to be
generated by the asset. Projected cash flow is discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flow and the time value of
money . The cost approach, which estimates value  by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility , was used, as
appropriate, for plant, property and equipment. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the property , less an
allowance for loss in value due to depreciation.
The followin g table summarizes the consideration to AOL ’s shareholders and the identification of the assets acquired, including cash acquired of $0.5 billion, and
liabilities assumed as of the close of the acquisition, as well as the fair value at the acquisition date of AOL ’s noncontrolling interests:
 
(dollars in millions)   As of June 23, 2015  
Cash payment to AOL ’s equity holders   $ 3,764  
Estimated liabilities to be paid    377 
     
Total consideration   $ 4,141

Noncontrolling interest    (1) 
     
Total consideration   $ 4,141  
     
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, we made cash payments of $179 million in respect of acquisition-date estimated liabilities to be paid. As of
December 31, 2016, the remaining balance of estimated liabilities to be paid was $198 million.
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideratio n transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. The
goodwill recorded as a result of the AOL transaction represents future economic benefits we expec t to achieve as a result of combining the operations of AOL and
Verizon as well as assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recogni zed. The goodwill related to this acquisition is included within
Corporate and other (see Note 3 for additional details).
Acquisition of Y ahoo! Inc.’ s Operating Business
On July 23, 2016, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire the stock of one or more subsidiaries of Yahoo holding all of Yahoo’ s operating
business for approximate ly $4.83 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the Transaction). Prior to the closing of the Transaction, pursuant to a related
reorganization agreement, Yahoo will transfer all of the assets and liabilities constituting Yahoo’ s operating business to the subsidiaries to be acquired in the
Transaction. The assets to be acquired will not include Yahoo’ s cash, its ownership interests in Alibaba, Yahoo! Japan and certain other investments, certain
undeveloped land recently divested by Yahoo or certain non-core intellectual property . We will receive for our benefit and that of our current and certain future
affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to all of Y ahoo’ s intellectual property that is not being conveyed with the business.
Yahoo employees who transfer to Verizon will have any unvested Yahoo restricted stock units that they hold converted into cash-settleable Verizon restricted
stock units, which will have the same vesting schedule as their Yahoo restricted stock units. The value of those outstanding restricted stock units on the date of
signing was approximately $1.1 billion.
On February 20, 2017, Verizon and Yahoo entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Transaction purchase price will be
reduced by $350 million to approximately $4.48 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Subject to certain exceptions, the parties also agreed that certain
user security  and data breaches incurred by Yahoo (and the losses arising therefrom) will be disregarded (1) for purposes of specified conditions to Verizon’ s
obligations to close the T ransaction and (2) in determining whether a “Business Material Adverse Ef fect” under the Purchase Agreement has occurred.
Concurrently with the amendment of the Purchas e Agreement, Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Yahoo that Verizon has agreed to
purchase pursuant to the Transaction, also entered into an amendment to the related reorganization agreement, pursuant to which Yahoo (which has announced
that it intends to change its name to Altaba Inc. following the closing of the Transaction) will retain 50% of certain post-closing liabilities arising out of
governmental or third party investigations, litigations or other claims related to certain user security and data breaches incurred by Yahoo. In accordance with the
original Transaction Agreements, Yahoo will continue to retain 100% of any liabilities arising out of any shareholder lawsuits (including derivative claims) and
investigations and actions by the SEC.
The Transac tion remains  subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of Yahoo’s stockholders, and is expected to close in the second quarter
of 2017.
Fleetmatics Gr oup PLC
On July 30, 2016, we entered into an agreement (the T ransaction Agreement) to acquire Fleetmatics Group PLC, a public limited company incorporated in Ireland
(Fleetmatics). Fleetmatic s is a leading global provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions. Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement,
we acquired Fleetmatics for $60.00 per ordinary share in cash. The aggregate merger consideration was approximately $2.5 billion, including cash acquired of
$0.1 billion. W e completed the acquisition on November 7, 2016. As a result of the transaction, Fleetmatics became a wholly-owned subsidiary of V erizon.(1)
(1)
The consolidated financial statements include the results of Fleetmatics’ operations from the date the acquisition closed. Had this acquisition been completed on
January 1, 2016 or 2015,  the results of the acquired operations of Fleetmatics would not have had a significant impact on the consolidated net income attributable
to Verizon. Upon closing, we recorded approximately $1.4 billion of goodwill and $1.1 billion of other intangibles.
The acquisit ion of Fleetmatics was accounted for as a business combination. The consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based
on their fair values as of the close of the acquisition.
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideratio n transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. The
goodwill recorded as a result of the Fleetmatics transaction represents future economic benefits we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition. The goodwill
related to this acquisition is included within Corporate and other (see Note 3 for additional details).
Other
On July 29, 2016, we acquired Telogis, Inc., a global cloud-based mobile enterprise management software business, for $0.9 billion of cash consideration. Upon
closing, we recorded $0.5 billion of goodwill that is included within Corporate and other .
On September 12, 2016,  we announced an agreement to acquire a leading provider of IoT solutions for smart communities for cash consideration that is not
significant. The transaction was completed in October 2016.
On September 3, 2015, AOL  announced an agreement to acquire an advertising technology business for cash consideration that was not significant. The
transaction was completed in October 2015.
On October 7, 2014, Redbox Instant by Verizon, a venture between Verizon and Redbox Auto mated Retail, LLC (Redbox), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Outerwall Inc., ceased providing service to its customers. In accordance with an agreement between the parties, Redbox withdrew from the venture on
October 20, 2014 and Verizon wound down and dissolved the venture during the fourth quarter of 2014. As a result of the termination of the venture, we recorded
a pre-tax  loss of $0.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.
During February 2014, we acquired a business dedicated to the development of IP television for cash consideration that was not significant.
Real Estate T ransaction
On May 19, 2015, we consummated a sale-leaseb ack transaction with a financial services firm for the buildings and real estate at our Basking Ridge, New Jersey
location. We received total gross proceeds of $0.7 billion resulting in a deferred gain of $0.4 billion, which will be amortized over the initial leaseback term of
twenty years . The leaseback of the buildings and real estate is accounted for as an operating lease. The proceeds received as a result of this transaction have been
classified within Cash flows used in investing activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015.

During the second quarte r of 2016, we allocated $0.1 billion of Goodwill on a relative fair value basis from Wireline to Other as a result of the reclassification of
our telematics businesses (see Note 12 for additional details). During the fourth quarter of 2016,  we allocated $0.4 billion of Goodwill on a relative fair value
basis from Wireline to Non-current  assets  held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 as a result of our agreement to sell 24 data
center sites (see Note 2 for additional details). As a result of acquisitions completed during 2016, we recognized preliminary Goodwill of $2.3 billion, which is
included within Other (see Note 2 for additional details).
As a result of the acquis ition of AOL in the second quarter of 2015, we recognized Goodwill of $1.9 billion, which is included within Other (see Note 2 for
additional details). We also allocated $0.6 billion  of goodwill on a relative fair value basis from Wireline to Other as a result of an internal reorganization. This
increase was partially offset by a decrease in Goodwill in Wireline primarily due to the reclassification of $1.3 billion of Goodwill to Non-current  assets held for
sale on our consolidated  balance sheet at December 31, 2015 as a result of the Access Line Sale (see Note 2 for additional details). The amount of Goodwill
reclassified was based on a relative fair value basis.

Credit facilities
On September 23, 2016, we amended our $8.0 billion credit facility to increase the availability to $9.0 billion and extend the maturity to September 23, 2020. As
of December 31, 2016, the unused borrowing capacity under our $9.0 billion credit facility was approximately $8.9 billion. The credit facility does not require us
to comply with financial  covenants or maintain specified credit ratings, and it permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change.
We use the credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit and for general corporate purposes.
In March 2016, we enter ed into an equipment credit facility insured by Eksportkreditnamnden Stockholm, Sweden (EKN), the Swedish export credit agency , with
the ability to borrow up to $1 billion to finance locally-sourced network equipment-related purchases. The facility has borrowings available through June 2017,
contingent upon the amount of equipment-related  purchases made by Verizon. As of December 31, 2016 we had drawn $0.5 billion on the facility and the unused
borrowing capacity was $0.5 billion.

proceeds from the sale of the notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the financing of our acquisition of Fleetmatics and the repayment of
outstanding indebtedness.
During December 2016, we redeemed in whole $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Verizon Communications 1.35% Notes due 2017 at 100.321% of the

2017 T erm Loan Agr eement
During January 2017, we entered into a term loan credit agreement with a syndicate of major financial institutions, pursuant to which we can borrow up to
$5.5 billion for (i) the acquisition of Yahoo and (ii) general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the term loan credit agreement mature 18 months following the
funding date, with a partial mandatory prepayment required within six months following the funding date. The term loan agreement contains certain negative
covenants, including a negative pledge covenant,  a merger or similar transaction covenant and an accounting changes covenant, affirmative covenants and events
of default that are customary for companies main taining an investment grade credit rating. In addition, the term loan credit agreement requires us to maintain a
leverage ratio (as defined  in the term loan credit agreement) not in excess of 3.50:1.00, until our credit ratings are equal to or higher than A3 and A- at Moody’ s
Investor Service and S&P Global Ratings, respectively . To date, we have not drawn on this term loan.
January 2017 Exchange Offers and Cash Offers
On January 25, 2017, we commenced eighteen separate private offers to exchange (the January  2017 Exchange Offers) specified series of outstanding Notes

Term Loan Agr eement
During the first quarter of 2015, we entered into a term loan agreement with a major financial institution, pursuant to which we borrowed $6.5 billion for general
corporate purposes, including the acquisition of spectrum licenses. Borrowings under the term loan agreement were to mature in March 2016, with a $4.0 billion
mandatory prepayment required in June 2015. The term loan agreement contained certain negative covenants, including a negative pledge covenant, a merger or
similar trans action covenant and an accounting changes covenant, affirmative covenants and even ts of default that are customary for companies maintaining an
investment grade credit rating. In addition, the term loan agreement required us to maintain a leverage ratio (as defined in the term loan agreement) not in excess
of 3.50:1.00, until our credit ratings were equal to or higher than A3 and A- at Moody’ s Investors Service and Standard & Poor ’s Ratings Services, respectively .
During March 2015, we prepaid approximately $5.0 billion of the term loan agreement, which satisfied the mandatory prepayment. During the third and fourth
quarters of 2015, respectively , we made repayments of approximately $1.0 billion and $0.5 billion. As of December 31, 2015, no amounts remained outstanding
under the term loan agreement.
Other
During June 2015, as part of the Merger Agreement with AOL, we assumed approximately $0.6 billion of debt and capital lease obligations. During 2015,
approximately $0.4 billion of the assumed debt and capital lease obligations were repaid.
During Octo ber 2015, we executed a $0.2 billion, 1.5% loan due 2018. Also, during March 2015, $0.5 billion of floating rate Verizon Communications Notes
matured and were repaid. During November 2015, $1.0 billion of 0.7% V erizon Communications Notes matured and were repaid.
During December 2015, we repaid $0.6 billion upon maturity for €0.5 billion aggregate principal amount of Cellco Partnership and Verizon Wireless Capital LLC
8.750% Notes due 2015, and the related cross currency swap was settled.
Asset-Backed Debt
As of Decem ber 31, 2016, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $5.0 billion. Our asset- backed debt includes notes (the Asset-Backed Notes) issued to
third-party investors (Investors) and loans (ABS Financing Facility) received from banks and their conduit facilities (collectively , the Banks). Our consolidated
asset-backed securitizatio n bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, an ABS Entity or collectively , the ABS Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the
transaction documentation in connection with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-backed debt, we transfer device payment plan
agreement receivables from Cellco Partnership and certain other affiliates of Verizon (collective ly, the Originators) to one of the ABS Entities, which in turn
transfer such receivables to another ABS Entity that issues the debt. Verizon entities retain the equity interests in the ABS Entities, which represent the rights to
all funds not needed to make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other related payments and expenses.
Our asset-ba cked debt is secured by the transferred device payment plan agreement receivables and future collections on such receivables. The device payment
plan agreem ent receivabl es transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily  of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of asset-
backed debt and expenses related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of device payment plan agreement receivables, and other
obligations arising from our asset-backed debt transactions, and will not be available to pay other obligations or claims of Verizon’ s creditors until the associated
asset-backed debt and other obligations are satisfied. The Investors or Banks, as applicable, whic h hold our asset-backed debt have legal recourse to the assets
securing the debt, but do not have any recourse to Verizon with respect to the payment of princip al and interest on the debt. Under a parent support agreement,
Verizon has agreed to guarantee certain of the payment obligations of Cellco Partnership and the Originators to the ABS Entities.
Cash collections on the device payment plan agreement receivables are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the
segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
Proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions , deposits to the segregated accounts and payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of device
payment plan agreement receivables, are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Repayments of our asset-
backed debt and related interest payments made  from the segregated accounts are non-cash  activities and therefore are not reflected within Cash flows from
financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The asset-backed debt issued and the assets securing this debt are included on our consolidated
balance sheets.
Asset-Backed Notes
In July 2016, we issued $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior and junior asset-backed notes through an ABS Entity , of which $1.1 billion of notes
were sold to Investors. The senior asset-backed notes have an expected weighted-average life of about 2.5 years and bear interest at 1.42% per annum. The junior
asset-backed notes have an expected weighted-average life of about 3.2 years and bear interest at a weighted-average rate of 1.53%.
In November 2016, we issued $1.4 billion aggre gate principal amount of senior and junior asset- backed notes through an ABS Entity . The senior asset-backed
notes have an expected weighted-average life of about 2.6 years and bear interest at 1.68% per annum. The junior asset-backed notes have an expected weighted-
average life of about 3.3 years and bear interest at a weighted-average rate of 2.26%.
Under the terms of the asset-backed notes, there is a two year revolving period during which we may transfer additional receivables to the ABS Entity .
ABS Financing Facility
During September 2016, we entered into a device payment plan agreement financing facility through an ABS Entity with a number of financial institutions.
Under the terms of the ABS Financing Facility , such counterparties made advances under asset-backed loans backed by device payment plan agreement
receivables for proceeds of $1.5 billion. We had the option of requesting an additional $1.5 billion of committed funding. During December 2016, we received
additional funding of $1.0 billion under this option. These loans have an expected weighted-average life of about 2.4 years and bear interest at floating rates.
There is a two year revolving period, which may be extended, during which we may transfer additional receivables to the ABS Entity . Subject to certain
conditions, we may also remove receivables from the ABS Entity . We may prepay the outstanding amounts of the loans without penalty , but in certain cases, with
breakage costs. As of December 31, 2016, outstanding borrowings under the ABS Financing Facility were $2.5 billion.
Although the ABS Financing Facility is fully drawn as of December 31, 2016, we have the right  to prepay all or a portion thereof at any time. If we choose to
prepay , the amount prepaid shall be available for further drawdowns until September 2018, except in certain circumstances.
Variable Inter est Entities (VIEs)
The ABS Entities meet the definition of a VIE for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary as we have both the power to direct the activities of
the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entity . Therefore, the
assets, liabilities and activities of the ABS Entities are consolidated in our financial results and are included in amounts presented on the face of our consolidated
balance sheets.
The assets and liabilities related to our asset-backed debt arrangements included on our consolidated balance sheets were as follows:
 
   (dollars in millions)  
At December 31,   2016    2015  
Assets     
Account receivable, net   $        3,383     $        –

Long-term debt    4,988      –  
See Note 7 for more information on device payment plan agreement receivables used to secure asset-backed debt.
Early Debt Redemption and Other Costs
During 2016 , we recorded net pre-tax  losses on early debt redemption of $1.8 billion primarily in connection with the April Tender Offers and the April Early
Debt Redemption.
We recognize early debt redemption costs in Othe r income and (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income and within our Net cash used in financing
activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Additional Financing Activities (Non-Cash  Transaction)
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we financed, primarily through vendor financing arrangements, the purchase of approximately $0.5 billion
and $0.7 billion, respectively , of long-lived assets consisting primarily of network equipment. At December 31, 2016, $1.1 billion relating to vendor financing
arrangements, including those entered into in prior years, remained outstanding. These purchases are non-cash  financ ing activities and therefore not reflected
within Capital expenditures on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Guarantees
We guarantee the debentures of our operating telephone company subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2016, $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of these
obligations remained outstanding. Each guarantee will remain in place for the life of the obligation unless terminated pursuant to its terms, including the operating
telephone company no longer being a wholly-owned subsidiary of V erizon.
As a result of the closing  of the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016, GTE Southwest Inc., Verizon California Inc. and Verizon Florida LLC are no longer wholly-
owned subsi diaries of Verizon, and the guarantees of $0.6 billion aggregate principal amount of debentures and first mortgage bonds of those entities have
terminated pursuant to their terms.
We also guarantee the debt obligations of GTE LLC as successor in interest to GTE Corporation that were issued and outstanding prior to July 1, 2003. As of
December 31, 2016, $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of these obligations remain outstanding.
Debt Covenants
We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our financial and restrictive covenants.
Maturities of Long-T erm Debt

Wireless Device Payment Plans
Under the Verizon devic e payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase wireless devices under a device payment plan agreement. Customers that
activate service on devices purchased under the device payment program pay lower service fees as compared to those under our fixed-term service plans, and
their device payment plan char ge is included on their standard wireless monthly bill.

Included in our device payment plan agreement receivables, net at December 31, 2016 are net device payment plan agreement receivables of $5.7 billion that
have been transferred to ABS Entities and continue to be reported in our consolidated financial statements.
We may offer our customers certain promotions where a customer can trade-in  his or her owned device  in connection with the purchase of a new device. Under
these types of promotions, the customer will receive trade-in  credits that are applied to the customer ’s monthly bill. As a result, we recognize a trade-in  obligation
measured at fair value using weighted-average selling prices obtained in recent resales of devices eligible for trade-in.  Device payment plan agreement
receivables, net does not reflect this trade-in  obligation. At December 31, 2016, the amount of trade-in  obligations was not significant.
At the time of sale of a device, we impute risk adjusted interest on the device payment plan agreement receivables. We record the imputed interest as a reduction
to the related accounts receivable. Interest income, which is included within Service revenues and other on our consolidated statements of income, is recognized
over the financed device payment term.
When originating device payment plan agreements, we use internal and external data sources to create a credit risk score to measure the credit quality of a
customer and to determi ne eligibility for the device payment program. If a customer is either new to Verizon Wireless or has less than 210 days of customer
tenure with Verizon Wireless (a new customer), the credit decision process relies more heavily on external data sources. If the customer has 210 days or more of
customer tenure with Verizon Wireless (an existi ng customer), the credit decision process relies on internal data sources. Verizon Wireless’  experience has been
that the payment attribut es of longer tenured customers are highly predictive when considering their ability to pay in the future. External data sources include
obtaining a credit report from a national consumer credit reporting agency , if available. Verizon Wireless uses its internal data and/or credit data obtained from the
credit report ing agencies to create a custom credit risk score. The custom credit risk score is generated automatically (except with respect to a small number of
applications where the information needs manual  intervention) from the applicant’ s credit data using Verizon Wireless’ proprietary custom credit models, which
are empirically derived, demonstrably and statis tically sound. The credit risk score measures the likelihood that the potential customer will become severely
delinquent and be disconnected for non-payment.  For a small  portion of new customer applicatio ns, a traditional credit report is not available from one of the
national credit reporting agencies because the potential customer does not have sufficient credit history. In those instances, alternate credit data is used for the risk
assessment.
Based on the custom credit risk score, we assign each customer to a credit class, each of which has a specified required down payment percentage and specified
credit limits. Device payment plan agreement receivables originated from customers assigned to credit classes requiring no down payment represent the lowest
risk. Device payment plan agreement receivables originated from customers assigned to credit classes requiring a down payment represent a higher risk.
Subsequent to origination, Verizon Wireless monitors delinquency and write-of f experience as key credit quality indicators for its portfolio of device payment
plan agreements and fixed-term service plans. The extent of our collection efforts with respect to a particular customer are based on the results of proprietary
custom empirically derived internal behavioral scoring models which analyze the customer ’s past performance to predict the likelihood of the customer falling
further delinquent. These customer scoring models assess a number of variables, including origination characteristics, customer account history and payment
patterns. Based on the score derived from these models, accounts are grouped by risk category to determine the collection strategy to be applied to such accounts.
We continuously monitor collection performance  results and the credit quality of our device payment plan agreement receivables based on a variety of metrics,
including aging. Verizon Wireless considers an account to be delinquent and in default status if there are unpaid charges remaining on the account on the day after
the bill’ s due date.
The balance and aging of the device payment plan agreement receivables on a gross basis was as follows:

Customers that entered into device payment plan agreements prior to May 31, 2015 have the right to upgrade their device, subject to certain conditions, including
making a stated portion of the required device payment plan agreement payments and trading in their device in good working order . Generally , customers entering
into device payment plan agreements on or after June 1, 2015 are required to repay all amounts due under their device payment plan agreements before being
eligible to upgrade their device. However , on select devices, certain marketing promotions have been revocably offered to customers to upgrade to a new device
after paying down a certain specified portion of the required device payment plan agreement amount as well as trading in their device in good working order .
When a customer enters into a device payment plan agreement with the right to upgrade to a new device, we record a guarantee liability in accordance with our
accounting policy .
Sales of W ireless Device Payment Plan Agr eement Receivables
During 2015  and 2016, we established programs  pursuant to a Receivables Purchase Agreement, or RPA, to sell from time to time, on an uncommitted basis,
eligible device payment plan agreement receiva bles to a group of primarily relationship banks  (Purchasers) on both a revolving (Revolving Program) and
non-revolving  (Non-Revolving  Program) basis. The receivables sold under the RPA are no longer considered assets of Verizon. The outstanding portfolio of
device paym ent plan agreement receivables derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet, but which we continue to service, was $4.3 billion at
December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the total portfolio of device payment plan agreement receivables, including derecognized device payment plan
agreement receivables, that we are servicing was $16.1 billion.
Under the Non-Revolving  Program, we transfer the eligible receivables to wholly-owned subsidiaries that are bankruptcy remote special purpose entities
(Sellers). The Sellers then sell the receivables to the Purchasers for upfront cash proceeds and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables (the
deferred purchase price). Under the Revolving Program, we sell eligible device payment plan agreement receivables on a revolving basis, subject to a maximum
funding limit, to the Purchasers. Sales of eligible receivables by the Sellers, once initiated, general ly occur and are settled on a monthly basis. Customer payments
made towards receivables sold under the Revolving Program will be available to purchase additional eligible device payment plan agreement receivables
originated during the revolving period. W e elected to end the revolving period in July 2016.
We continue to bill and collect on the receivables in exchange for a monthly servicing fee, whic h is not material. Eligible receivables under the RPA excluded
device paym ent plan agreements where a new customer was required to provide a down payment. The sales of receivables under the RPA did not have a material
impact on our consolidated statements of incom e. The cash proceeds received from the Purch asers are recorded within Cash flows provided by operating
activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
During 2016 , we sold $3.3 billion of receivables, net of allowance and imputed interest, under the Revolving Program. We received cash proceeds from new
transfers of $2.0 billion and cash proceeds from reinvested collections of $0.9 billion, and recorded a deferred purchase price of $0.4 billion.
During 2015, we sold $6.1 billion of receivables, net of allowances and imputed interest, under the Non-Revolving  Program. In connection  with this sale, we
received cash proceeds from new transfers of $4.5 billion and recorded a deferred purchase price of $1.7 billion. During 2015, we also sold $3.3 billion of
receivables, net of allow ances and imputed intere st, under the Revolving Program. In connection with this sale, we received cash proceeds from new transfers of
$2.7 billion and recorded a deferred purchase price of $0.6 billion.
Deferr ed Pur chase Price
Under the RPA, the deferred purchase price was initially recorded at fair value, based on the remaining device payment amounts expected to be collected,
adjusted, as applicable, for the time value of money and by the timing and estimated value of the device trade-in  in connectio n with upgrades. The estimated
value of the device trade-in  considers prices expected to be offered to us by independent third parties. This estimate contemplates changes in value after the
launch of a device. The fair value measuremen ts are considered to be Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy . The collection of the deferred
purchase price is contingent on collections from customers. To date, we have collected $1.1 billio n which was returned as deferred purchase price and recorded
within Cash flows provided by operating activitie s on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Collections which were returned as deferred purchase price and
recorded within Cash flows provided by investin g activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows were immaterial. At December 31, 2016, our deferred
purchase price receivable , which is held by the Sellers, was comprised of $1.2 billion included within Prepaid expenses and other and $0.4 billion included within
Other assets in our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2015, our deferred purchase price receivable was $2.2 billion, which was included within Other
assets in our consolidated balance sheet.
Variable Inter est Entities (VIEs)
Under the RPA, the Sellers’ sole business consists of the acquisition of the receivables from Cellco Partnership and certain other affiliates of Verizon and the
resale of the receivables to the Purchasers. The assets of the Sellers are not available to be used to satisfy obligations of any Verizon entities other than the Sellers.
We determined that the Sellers are VIEs as they lack sufficient equity to finance their activities. Given that we have the power to direct the activities of the Sellers
that most significantly impact the Sellers’ econo mic performance, we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the Sellers. As a result, we consolidate the
assets and liabilities of the Sellers into our consolidated financial statements.
Continuing Involvement
Verizon has continuing involvement with the sold receivables as it services the receivables. We continue to service the customer and their related receivables on
behalf of the Purchasers,  including facilitating customer payment collection, in exchange for a monthly servicing fee. While servicing the receivables, the same
policies and procedures are applied to the sold receivables that apply to owned receivables, and we continue to maintain normal relationships with our customers.
The credit quality of the customers we continue to service is consistent throughout the periods presented. To date, we have collected and remitted approximately
$7.1 billion, net of fees. T o date, cash proceeds received, net of remittances, were $3.0 billion. During 2016, credit losses on receivables sold were $0.2 billion.
In addition, we have continuing involvement related to the sold receivables as we may be responsible for absorbing additional credit losses pursuant to the
agreements. The Company’ s maximum exposure to loss related to the involvement with the Seller s is limited to the amount of the outstanding deferred purchase
price, which  was $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2016. The maximum exposure to loss represents an estimated loss that would be incurred under severe,
hypothetical circumstanc es whereby the Company would not receive the portion of the proceeds withheld by the Purchasers. As we believe the probability of
these circumstances occurring is remote, the maximum exposure to loss is not an indication of the Company’ s expected loss.

Equity securities consist of investments in common stock of domestic and international corporations measured using quoted prices in active markets.
Fixed income securities consist primarily of investments in municipal bonds as well as U.S. Treasury securities. We use quoted prices in active markets for our
U.S. Treasury securities, therefore these securities are classified as Level 1. For all other fixed income securities that do not have quoted prices in active markets,
we use alternative matrix pricing resulting in these debt securities being classified as Level 2.
Derivative contracts are valued using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative contracts and thus are
classified within Level 2. We use mid-market  pricing for fair value measurements of our derivative instruments. Our derivative instruments are recorded on a
gross basis.
We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers within the fair value hierarchy
during 2016.
Fair V alue of Short-term and Long-term Debt
The fair value of our debt is determined using various methods, including quoted prices for identical terms and maturities, which is a Level 1 measurement, as
well as quoted prices for similar terms and maturities in inactive markets and future cash flows discounted at current rates, which are Level 2 measurements. The
fair value of our short-term and long-term debt, excluding capital leases, was as follows:

Derivative Instruments
Inter est Rate Swaps
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates based on
LIBOR, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against interest rate risk exposure
of designated debt issuan ces. We record the interest rate swaps at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value
of the interest rate swaps are recorded to Interest expense, which are of fset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt due to changes in interest rates.
During 2015, we entered  into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $5.8 billion. During  2016, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional
value of $6.3 billion and settled $0.9 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps. The ineffective portion of these interest rate swaps was not material at
December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Forwar d Inter est Rate Swaps
In order to manage our exposure to future intere st rate changes, we have entered into forward interest rate swaps. We designated these contracts as cash flow
hedges. During 2015, we settled $2.0 billion notional amount of forward interest rate swaps for a pre-tax  loss that was not mater ial, and entered into forward
interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $0.8 billion. During 2016, we entered into forwa rd interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $1.3 billion
and settled $2.0 billion notional amount of these forward interest rate swaps. During 2016, a pre-tax  loss of $0.2 billion was recognized in Other comprehensive
income (loss). During 2015, a pre-tax  loss of $0.1 billion was recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss).
Cross Curr ency Swaps
We have entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange our Britis h Pound Sterling and Euro-denominated debt into U.S. dollars
and to fix our future interest and principal payme nts in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. During 2015,
we settled $0.6 billion of cross currency swaps on maturity . During 2016, we entered into cross currency swaps with a total notional value of $3.3 billion and
settled $0.1 billion notional amount of cross currency swaps upon redemption of the related debt.
A portion of the gains and losses recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) was reclassified to Other income and (expense), net to offset the related
pre-tax  foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the underlying debt obligations. During 2016 and 2015, pre-tax  losses of $0.1 billion and $1.2 billion,
respectively , were recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) with respect to these swaps.
Net Investment Hedges
We have designated certain foreign currency instruments as net investment hedges to mitiga te foreign exchange exposure related to non-U.S.  dollar net
investments in certain foreign subsidiaries agains t changes in foreign exchange rates. During 2015 , we entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a total
notional value of $0.9 billion and designated them as net investment hedges. During 2016, we de-designated  and settled these hedge s. We simultaneously
designated $0.8 billion total notional value of Euro-denominated debt as a net investment hedge.
Undesignated Derivatives
We also have the following derivative which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting.
Inter est Rate Caps
We enter into interest rate caps to mitigate our interest exposure to interest rate increases on our ABS Financing Facility . During 2016, we entered into such
interest rate caps with a notional value of $2.5 billion and recognized an immaterial reduction in Interest expense.
The following table sets forth the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments:
 
   At December  31, 2016    At December 31, 2015  
(dollars in millions)   Notional Amount    Notional Amount  
Interest rate swaps   $ 13,099     $ 7,620   
Forward interest rate swaps    –     750  
Cross currency swaps    12,890      9,675   
Net investment hedge    –     864  
Interest rate caps    2,540      –  
Concentrations of Cr edit Risk
Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary  cash investments, short-term and long-term investments, trade
receivables, including device payment plan agree ment receivables, certain notes receivable, including lease receivables, and derivative contracts. Our policy is to
deposit our temporary cash investments with major financial institutions. Counterparties to our derivative contracts are also major financial institutions with
whom we have negotiate d derivatives agreements (ISDA master agreement) and credit support annex agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange. We
generally apply collateralized arrangements with our counterparties for uncleared derivatives to mitigate credit risk. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we posted
collateral of approximate ly $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively , related to derivative contract s under collateral exchange arrangements, which were recorded
as Prepaid expenses and other in our consolidated balance sheets. During the first and second quarters of 2015, we paid an immaterial amount of cash to enter into
amendments to certain collateral exchange arrang ements. These amendments suspend cash collateral posting for a specified period of time by both counterparties.
We are in the process of negotiating extension s to amendments expiring during 2017. We may enter into swaps on an uncollateralized basis in certain
circumstances. While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect the
settlement of these transactions to have a material ef fect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Stock-Based Compensation
Verizon Communications Long-T erm Incentive Plan
The Verizon Communications Inc. Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the Plan) permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted
stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards. The maximum number of shares available for awards from the Plan is 119.6 million
shares.
Restricted Stock Units
The Plan provides for grants of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. The RSUs are generally classified as
equity award s because the RSUs will be paid in Verizon common stock upon vesting. The RSU  equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of
Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. Dividend equivalent units are also paid to participants at the time the RSU
award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award.
Performance Stock Units
The Plan also provides for grants of Performance  Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. As defined by the Plan, the
Human Reso urces Committee of the Board of Directors determines the number of PSUs a participant earns based on the extent to which the corresponding
performance goals have been achieved over the three-year performance cycle. The PSUs are classified as liability awards because the PSU awards are paid in
cash upon vesting. The PSU award liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, will fluctuate based on the price of
Verizon common stock as well as performance relative to the targets. Dividend equivalent units are also paid to participants at the time that the PSU award is
determined and paid, and in the same proportion as the PSU award. The granted and cancelled activity for the PSU award includes adjustments for the
performance goals achieved.
The following table summarizes V erizon’ s Restricted Stock Unit and Performance Stock Unit activity:

As of December 31, 2016, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of Verizon’ s RSUs and PSUs was approximately $0.3 billion and
is expected to be recognized over approximately two years.
The RSUs granted in 2016 and 2015 have weighted-average grant date fair values of $51.86 and $48.15 per unit, respectively . During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we
paid $0.4 billion, $0.4 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively , to settle RSUs and PSUs classified as liability awards.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
After -tax compensation expense for stock-based compensation related to RSUs and PSUs described abov e included in Net income attributable to Verizon was
$0.4 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively .
 
Note 10
Employee Benefits
We maintain non-contributory  defined benefit pension plans for certain employ ees. In addition, we maintain postretirement health care and life insurance plans
for certain retirees and their dependents, which are both contributory and non-contributory , and include a limit on our share of the cost for certain recent and
future retirees. In accord ance with our accounting policy for pension and other postretirement benefits, operating expenses include pension and benefit related
credits and/or charges based on actuarial assumptions, including projected discount rates, an estimated return on plan assets, and health care trend rates. These
estimates are updated in the fourth quarter to reflect actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions. The adjustment is recognized in the income
statement during the fourth quarter or upon a remeasurement event pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
Pension and Other Postr etirement Benefits
Pension and other postretirement benefits for certain employees are subject to collective bargaini ng agreements. Modifications in benefits have been bargained
from time to time, and we may also periodically amend the benefits in the management plans. The following tables summarize benefit costs, as well as the benefit
obligations, plan assets, funded status and rate assumptions associated with pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans.

2016 Collective Bar gaining Negotiations
In the collective bargaini ng agreements ratified in June 2016, Verizon’ s annual postretirement benefit obligation for retiree healthcare remains capped at the levels
established by the previo us contracts ratified in 2012. Effective January 2016, prior to reaching these new collective bargaining agreements, certain retirees began
to pay for the costs of retiree healthcare in accordance with the provisions relating to caps in the previous contracts. In reaching new collective bargaining
agreements in 2016, there is a mutual understanding that the substantive postretirement benef it plans provide that Verizon’ s annual postretirement benefit
obligation for retiree healthcare is capped and, accordingly , we began accounting for the contractual healthcare caps in June 2016. We also adopted changes to our
defined bene fit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to reflect the agreed upon terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreements. The
impact was a reduction in our postretirement bene fit plan obligations of approximately $5.1 billion and an increase in our defined benefit pension plan obligations
of approximately $0.4 billion, which have been recorded as a net increase to Accumulated other comprehensive income of $2.9 billion (net of taxes of $1.8
billion). The amount recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified  to net periodic benefit cost on a straight-line basis over the
average remaining servic e period of the respective plans’ participants which, on a weighted-average basis, is 12.2 years for defined benefit pension plans and 7.8
years for other postretire ment benefit plans. The above-noted reclassification resulted in a decreas e to net periodic benefit cost and increase to pre-tax  income of
approximately $0.4 billion during 2016.

Amounts reclassified to net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the reclassifica tion to Selling, general and administrative expense of a pre-tax
pension and postretirem ent benefit curtailment gain of $0.5 billion ($0.3 billion net of taxes) due to the transfer of employees to Frontier , which caused the
elimination of a significa nt amount of future service in three of our defined benefit pension plans and one of our other postretirement benefit plans requiring us to
recognize a portion of the prior service credits. See Note 2 for additional detail.
The estimate d prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from  Accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic
benefit (income) cost over the next fiscal year is not significant. The estimated prior service cost for the defined benefit postretirement plans that will be
amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit (income) cost over the next fiscal year is ($0.9) billion.
Assumptions
The weighted-average assumptions used in determining benefit obligations follow:
 
       Pension   Health Car e and Life  
At December 31,   2016   2015   2016   2015

The weighted-average assumptions used in determining net periodic cost follow:
 
   Pension   Health Car e and Life  
At December 31,   2016   2015   2014   2016   2015   2014

Expected return on plan assets    7.00    7.25    7.25    3.80    4.80    5.50  
Rate of compensation increases    3.00    3.00    3.00    N/A    N/A    N/A  
Effective January 1, 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the interest component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement
benefits. Historically , we estimated the interest cost component utilizing a single weighted-average  discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the
benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. W e have elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the
estimation of interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected
cash flows. We have made this change to provide a more precise measurement of interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows
to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. W e have accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and accordingly accounted for it prospectively .
For the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of this change on our consolidated GAAP results was a reduction of the interest cost component of net
periodic benefit cost by approximately $0.4 billion. The use of the full yield curve approach does not impact how we measure our total benefit obligations at year
end or our annual net periodic benefit cost as any change in the interest cost component is completely offset by the actuarial gain or loss measured at year end
which is immediately recognized in the income statement. Accordingly , this change in estimate did not impact our income from continuing operations, net income
or earnings per share as measured on an annual basis.
In determining our pensi on and other postretirem ent benefit obligations, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 4.2%. The rate was selected to approximate
the composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market  at December 31, 2016. The bonds selected had maturities that
coincided with the time periods during which benefits payments are expected to occur , were non-callable  and available in sufficient quantities to ensure
marketability (at least $0.3 billion par outstanding).
In order to project the long-term target investment return for the total portfolio, estimates are prepared for the total return of each major asset class over the
subsequent 10-year  period . Those estimates  are based on a combination of factors including the current market interest rates and valuation levels, consensus
earnings expectations and historical long-term risk premiums. To determine the aggregate return for the pension trust, the projected return of each individual asset
class is then weighted according to the allocation to that investment area in the trust’ s long-term asset allocation policy .
The assumed health care cost trend rates follow:
 
   Health Car e and Life  
At December 31,   2016   2015   2014  
Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year    6.50%   6.00%   6.50% 
Rate to which cost trend rate gradually declines    4.50    4.50    4.75  
Year the rate reaches the level it is assumed to remain thereafter    2025     2024     2022   
A one-percentage  point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following ef fects:
 
   (dollars in millions)  
One-Percentage  Point   Increase    Decr ease  
Effect on 2016 service and interest cost   $ 100    $ (81) 
Effect on postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016    609     (616) 
Plan Assets
The company’ s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets which allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk
and return. While target allocation percentages will vary over time, the current target allocation for plan assets is designed so that 65% of the assets have the
objective of achieving a return in excess of the growth in liabilities (comprised of public equities, private equities, real estate, hedge funds and emer ging debt) and
35% of the assets are invested as liability hedgin g assets (where cash flows from investments better match projected benefit payments, typically longer duration
fixed income). This alloc ation will shift as funded status improves to a higher allocation of liability hedging assets. Target policies will be revisited periodically to
ensure they are in line with fund objectives. Both active and passive management approaches are used depending on perceived market efficiencies and various
other factors . Due to our diversification and risk control processes, there are no significant concentrations of risk, in terms of sector , industry , geography or
company names.
Pension and healthcare and life plans assets do not include significant amounts of V erizon common stock.

The following are gener al descriptions of asset categories, as well as the valuation methodologies and inputs used to determine the fair value of each major
category of assets.
Cash and cash equivalen ts include short-term investment funds, primarily in diversified portfolios of investment grade money market instruments and are valued
using quoted market prices or other valuation methods.
Investments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last reported sale prices on the last business day of
the year or, if no sales were reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government obligations, corporate bonds, international bonds and asset-backed
securities are valued using matrix prices with input from independent third-party valuation sources. Over -the-counter  securities are valued at the bid prices or the
average of the bid and ask prices on the last business day of the year from published sources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable such as
multiple broker quotes.
Commingled funds not traded on national exch anges are priced by the funds’ custodian or administrator at NAV. Commingled funds held by third-party
custodians appointed by the fund managers provi de the fund managers with a NAV. The fund managers have the responsibility for providing this information to
the custodian of the respective plan.
The investment manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance, and natural resource limited partnership investments. Real estate investments are
valued at amounts based  upon appraisal reports prepared by either independent real estate appraisers or the investment manager using discounted cash flows or
market comp arable data.  Loans secured by mortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance or appraised value of the underlying properties. The values
assigned to these investm ents are based upon available and current market information and do not necessarily represent amounts which might ultimately be
realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, estimated fair values might differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready
market for the securities existed. These dif ferences could be material.
Forward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices prevailing on the last business day of the year.
Both exchange rates and market prices are readily available from published sources. These securities are classified by the asset class of the underlying holdings.
Hedge funds are valued by the custodian at NAV based on statements received from the investment manager . These funds are valued in accordance with the terms
of their corresponding of fering or private placement memoranda.
Commingled funds, hedge funds, venture capita l, corporate finance, natural resource and real estate limited partnership investments for which fair value is
measured using the NAV per share as a practic al expedient are not leveled within the fair value hierarchy and are included as a reconciling item to total
investments.
Employer  Contributions
In 2016, we contributed $0.8 billion to our qualified pension plans which included $0.2 billion of discretionary contributions, $0.1 billion to our nonqualified
pension plans and $1.1 billion to our other postretirement benefit plans. We anticipate a minimum contribution of $0.6 billion to our qualified pension plans in
2017. Nonqualified pension plans contributions are estimated to be $0.1 billion and contribution s to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be
$0.8 billion in 2017.
Estimated Futur e Benefit Payments
The benefit payments to retirees are expected to be paid as follows:
 
       (dollars in millions)  
Year   Pension Benefits    Health Car e and Life  
2017   $ 2,356     $ 1,259

2020    1,204      1,302   
2021    1,189      1,327   
2022-2026    5,777      6,616   
Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plans
We maintain four leverag ed employee stock ownership plans (ESOP). We match a certain percenta ge of eligible employee contributions to the savings plans with
shares of our common stock from this ESOP . At December 31, 2016, the number of allocated shares of common stock in this ESOP was 55 million. There were
no unallocated shares of common stock in this ESOP at December 31, 2016. All leveraged ESOP shares are included in earnings per share computations.
Total savings plan costs were $0.7 billion in 2016, $0.9 billion in 2015 and $0.9 billion in 2014.

Severance, Pension and Benefit Char ges (Cr edits)
During 2016, we recorded net pre-tax  severance, pension and benefit charges of $2.9 billion in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains
and losses in the period in which they occur . The pension and benefit remeasurement charges of $2.5 billion were primarily driven by a decrease in our discount
rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension and other postr etirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 4.6% at
December 31, 2015 to a weighted-average of 4.2% at December 31, 2016 ($2.1 billion), updated health care trend cost assumptions ($0.9 billion), the difference
between our estimated return on assets of 7.0% and our actual return on assets of 6.0% ($0.2 billion) and other assumption adjustments ($0.3 billion). These
charges were  partially offset by a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2016)  issued by the Society of
Actuaries ($0.5 billion) and lower negotiated prescription drug pricing ($0.5 billion). As part of these charges, we also recorded severance costs of $0.4 billion
under our existing separation plans.
The net pre-tax  severance, pension and benefit charges during 2016 were comprised of a net pre-tax  pension remeasurement charge of $0.2 billion measured as of
March 31, 2016 related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum  distributions in one of our defined benefit pension plans, a net pre-tax  pension and
benefit remeasurement charge of $0.8 billion measured as of April 1, 2016 related to curtailments in three of our defined benefit pension and one of our other
postretirement plans, a net pre-tax  pension and benefit remeasurement charge of $2.7 billion measured as of May 31, 2016 in two defined benefit pension plans
and three other postretirement benefit plans as a result of our accounting for the contractual healthcare caps and bargained for changes, a net pre-tax  pension
remeasurement charge of $0.1 billion measured as of May 31, 2016 related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum  distribution s in three of our
defined bene fit pension plans, a net pre-tax  pension remeasurement charge of $0.6 billion measured as of August 31, 2016 related to settlements for employees
who received lump-sum  distribution s in five of our defined benefit pension plans, and a net pre-tax  pension and benefit credit of $1.9 billion as a result of our
fourth quarter remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement assets and liabilities based on updated actuarial assumptions.
During 2015, we recorde d net pre-tax  severa nce, pension and benefit credits of approximately $2.3 billion primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in
accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which  they occur . The credits were primarily driven by an increase in
our discount rate assump tion used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 4.2% at December 31, 2014 to a weighted-average of 4.6%
at December 31, 2015 ($2.5 billion), the execution of a new prescription drug contract during 2015 ($1.0 billion) and a change in mortality assumptions primarily
driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2015)  issued by the Society of Actuaries ($0.9 billion), partially offset by the difference between our estimated
return on assets of 7.25% at December 31, 2014 and our actual return on assets of 0.7% at Decem ber 31, 2015 ($1.2 billion), severance costs recorded under our
existing separation plans ($0.6 billion) and other assumption adjustments ($0.3 billion).
During 2014, we recorde d net pre-tax  severa nce, pension and benefit charges of approx imately $7.5 billion primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in
accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which  they occur . The charges were primarily driven by a decrease in
our discount rate assump tion used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 5.0% at December 31, 2013 to a weighted-average of 4.2%
at December  31, 2014 ($5.2 billion), a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (RP-2014  and MP-2014)  issued by
the Society of Actuaries in October 2014 ($1.8 billion) and revisions to the retirement assumptio ns for participants and other assumption adjustments, partially
offset by the difference between our estimated return on assets of 7.25% and our actual return on assets of 10.5% ($0.6 billion). As part of this charge, we
recorded severance costs of $0.5 billion under our existing separation plans.

The following table shows the principal reasons for the dif ference between the ef fective income tax rate and the statutory federal income tax rate:

Statutory federal income tax rate    35.0%   35.0%   35.0%

Non-deductible  goodwill    2.2    –    –  
Other , net    (2.4)   (0.8)   (3.4) 
     
Effective income tax rate    35.2%   34.9%   21.7% 
     
The effective income tax rate for 2016 was 35.2%  compared to 34.9% for 2015. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the impact of
$527 million included in the provision for income  taxes from goodwill not deductible for tax purposes in connection with the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016.
This increase was partially offset by the impact that lower income before income taxes in the current period has on each of the reconciling items specified in the
table above. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to lower income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit charges
recorded in 2016 compared to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2015.
The effective income tax rate for 2015 was 34.9% compared to 21.7% for 2014. The increase in the effective income tax rate and provision for income taxes was
primarily due to the impact of higher income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2015 compared to severance, pension
and benefit charges recorded in 2014, as well as tax benefits associated with the utilization of certain tax credits in connection with the Omnitel Transaction in
2014.
The amounts of cash taxes paid are as follows:
 
   (dollars in millions)  
Years Ended December 31,   2016    2015    2014  
Income taxes, net of amounts refunded   $ 9,577     $5,293     $4,093

Total   $    12,569     $    8,445     $    7,180   
     
The increase in cash taxes paid during 2016 compared to 2015 was due to a $3.2 billion increase  in income taxes paid primarily as a result of the Access Line
Sale.
Deferred taxes arise because of differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabiliti es. Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities
are as follows:
 
   (dollars in millions)  
At December 31,   2016   2015

Net deferred tax liability   $    45,964    $    45,386   
     
At December 31, 2016, undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the United States amounted to approximately $2.3 billion.
The majority  of Verizon’ s cash flow is generated from domestic operations and we are not dependent on foreign cash or earnings to meet our funding
requirements, nor do we intend to repatriate these undistributed foreign earnings to fund U.S. operations. Furthermore, a portion of these undistributed earnings
represent amounts that legally must be kept in reserve in accordance with certain foreign jurisdictional requirements and are unavailable for distribution or
repatriation. As a result, we have not provided U.S. deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings  because we intend that they will remain indefinitely reinvested
outside of the United States and therefore unavailable for use in funding U.S. operations. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes related to
these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
At Decembe r 31, 2016, we had net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards for income tax purposes of approximately $3.3 billion that primarily relate to state and
foreign tax losses. Of these net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards, approximately $1.9 billion will expire between 2017 and 2036 and approximately
$1.4 billion may be carried forward indefinitely .
During 2016 , the valuation allowance decreased approximately $0.9 billion. The balance of the valuation allowance at December 31, 2016 is primarily related to
state and foreign tax losses and the 2016 activity is primarily the result of the utilization and expiration of certain tax attributes.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
 
      (dollars in millions)  
    2016   2015   2014

Included in the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is $1.5 billio n, $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively , that if recognized,
would favorably af fect the ef fective income tax rate.

Verizon and/or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. As a large taxpayer , we are
under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and multiple state and foreign jurisdictions for various open tax years. The IRS is currently examining the
Company’ s U.S. income  tax returns for tax years  2013-2014, Cellco Partnership’ s U.S. income tax return for tax year 2013, and AOL ’s U.S. income tax returns
for tax years 2011-2012. Tax controversies are ongoing for tax years as early as 2006. The amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the
next twelve months due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions and it is reasonably possible that various current tax examinations
will conclud e or require reevaluations of the Company’ s tax positions during this period. An estimate of the range of the possible change cannot be made until
these tax matters are further developed or resolved.

Segment Information
Reportable Segments
We have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and organize by products and services. We
measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income, consistent with the chief operating decision maker ’s assessment of segment
performance.
Our segments and their principal activities consist of the following:
 
Segment   Description
Wireless
  Wireless’ communications products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer ,
business and government customers across the United States.
Wireline
  Wireline’ s voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services include broadband video and data, corporate networking
solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these
products and services to consumers in the United  States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and
around the world.
Corporate and other includes the results of our digital media, including AOL, telematics and other businesses, investments in unconsolidated businesses,
unallocated corporate expenses, pension and other employee benefit related costs and lease financing. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of
divested operations and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assess ing segment performance due to their non-operational  nature.
Although such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses that are not
individually significant are included in all segment results as these items are included in the chief operating decision maker ’s assessment of segment performance.
On April 1, 2016, we completed the Access Line Sale. On July 1, 2014, our Wireline segment sold a non-strategic  business. See Note 2. The results of operations
for these divestitures are included within Corporate and other for all periods presented to reflect comparable segment operating results consistent with the
information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker .
In addition, Corporate and other includes the results of our telematics businesses for all periods presented, which were reclassified from our Wireline segment
effective April 1, 2016. The impact of this reclassification was not material to our consolidated financial statements or our segment results of operations.
The reconciliation of segment operating revenues and expenses to consolidated operating revenues and expenses below also includes those items of a
non-operational  nature. We exclude from segment results the effects of certain items that management does not consider in assessing segment performance,
primarily because of their non-operational  nature.
We have adjusted prior period consolidated and segment information, where applicable, to conform to current year presentation.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon’ s common stock under our authorized share buyback program.
During the year ended December 31, 2015, Verizon repurchased approximately 2.8 million share s of the Company’ s common stock under our authorized share
buyback program for approximately $0.1 billion. At December 31, 2016, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon
under our share buyback program was 97.2 million.
In addition to the previously authorized three-year share buyback program, in 2015, the V erizon Board of Directors authorized V erizon to enter into an accelerated
share repurchase (ASR) agreement to repurchas e $5.0 billion of the Company’ s common stock. On February 10, 2015, in exchange for an up-front  payment
totaling $5.0 billion, Verizon received an initial delivery of 86.2 million shares having a value of approximately $4.25 billion. On June 5, 2015, Verizon received
an additional 15.4 million shares as final settlement of the transaction under the ASR agreement. In total, 101.6 million shares were delivered under the ASR at an
average repurchase price of $49.21.
Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareowner plans. During the year ended
December 31, 2016, we issued 3.5 million common shares from Treasury stock, which had an immaterial aggregate value. During the year ended December 31,
2015, we issued 22.6 million common shares from T reasury stock, which had an aggregate value of $0.9 billion.
 
Note 15
Commitments and Contingencies
In the ordina ry course of business, Verizon is involved in various commercial litigation and regulatory proceedings at the state and federal level. Where it is
determined, in consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a given matter , the Company establishes
an accrual. In none of the currently pending matters is the amount of accrual material. An estimate  of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the
amounts already accrued cannot be made at this time due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including (1) uncertain damage theories and
demands; (2) a less than complete factual record; (3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; and (4) the unpredictable
nature of the opposing party and its demands. We continuously monitor these proceedings as they develop and adjust any accrual or disclosure as needed. We do
not expect that the ultimate resolution of any pending regulatory or legal matter in future periods, including the Hicksville matter described below , will have a
material ef fect on our financial condition, but it could have a material ef fect on our results of operations for a given reporting period.
Reserves have been established to cover environm ental matters relating to discontinued businesses  and past telecommunications activities. These reserves include
funds to address contam ination at the site of a former Sylvania facility in Hicksville NY, which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. In
September 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken
primary responsibility for addressing the contami nation at the site. An adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to
the past and future expen ses of all of the parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites
requiring remediation.
Verizon is currently involved in approximately 35 federal district court actions alleging that Verizon is infringing various patents. Most of these cases are brought
by non-practicing  entities and effectively seek only monetary damages; a small number are brought by companies that have sold products and could seek
injunctive relief as well. These cases have progr essed to various stages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise
resolved.
In connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the
purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial  matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as indemnity from certain financial losses. From
time to time, counterpar ties may make claims under these provisions, and Verizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary
course of business.
Subsequent to the sale of Verizon Information Services Canada in 2004, we continue to provide a guarantee to publish directories, which was issued when the
directory business was purchased in 2001 and had a 30-year  term (befor e extensions). The preexisting guarantee continues, without modification, despite the
subsequent sale of Verizon Information Services Canada and the spin-of f of our domestic print and Internet yellow pages directories business. The possible
financial impact of the guarantee, which is not expected to be adverse, cannot be reasonably estimated as a variety of the potential outcomes available under the
guarantee result in costs and revenues or benefits that may of fset each other . We do not believe performance under the guarantee is likely .
As of December 31, 2016, letters of credit totaling approximately $0.4 billion, which were executed in the normal course of business and support several
financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding.
We have several commit ments primarily to purchase programming and network services, equipment, software and marketing services, which will be used or sold
in the ordina ry course of business, from a variety of suppliers totaling $16.8 billion. Of this total amount, $6.9 billion is attributable to 2017, $6.4 billion is
attributable to 2018 through 2019, $1.3 billion is attributable to 2020 through 2021 and $2.2 billion is attributable to years thereafter . These amounts do not
represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. Our commitments are
generally determined based on the noncancelable  quantities or termination amounts. Purchases against our commitments totaled approximately $8.1 billion for
2016, $10.2 billion for 2015, and $21.0 billion for 2014. Since the commitments to purchase programming services from television networks and broadcast
stations have no minim um volume requirement, we estimated our obligation based on numbe r of subscribers at December 31, 2016, and applicable rates
stipulated in the contracts in ef fect at that time. W e also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment.
